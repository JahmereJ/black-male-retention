AB Background/Context: Historical narratives and contemporary research continue to produce scholarship on teacher-coaches through a White racial frame that both reifies a Western European origin story and centers the experiences of White males. However, the American history of teacher-coaches is not the Black history of teacher-coaches. The Black male teacher-coach tradition is anchored in the utilization of Black intellectual thought to implement revisionist ontology projects that simultaneously claim Black personhood and contest curricular genocide while being consumed within an anti-Black milieu. In this study, the tradition of Black male teacher-coaches' critical civic engagement within secondary schools is taken from the margins and centered.Purpose/Objective/Research Questions/Focus of Study: This study examines how Black male teacher-coaches utilize Black intellectual thought within secondary social studies and literature courses to combat a White-controlled epistemic order of knowledge. Within their courses, the participants purposefully challenge institutional forms of bad faith by utilizing Black intellectual thought to unsettle the coloniality of truth to challenge the existing anti-Black scholastic order of knowledge. Using the theoretical lenses of subjective understanding and bad faith, this study is guided by the following primary research question: How do Black men in predominantly non-Black schools utilize Black intellectual thought to enact their work as teacher-coaches?Research Design: The findings from this study emerge from an instrumental multiple case study that included four Black male teacher-coaches serving as secondary social studies or literature educators in schools that were not predominantly Black. Employing an interpretive approach within this methodology created space to redress the following two broader external interests: (1) de-essentializing the specificity of the Black male teacher-coach tradition from a Eurocentric dominant narrative, and (2) explicating the salience of Black intellectual thought in the counterhegemonic practices of these Black men relative to anti-intellectual tropes about teacher-coaches in general.Findings/Results: Findings indicate how participants continue the legacy of the long Civil Rights Movement by utilizing Black intellectual thought to enact a project of revisionist ontology to combat an anti-Black epistemic order of knowledge. The study explicates the following thematic findings: (1) carving out space for Black intellectual thought, (2) centering Black intellectual thought, and (3) making Black intellectual thought relevant.Conclusions/Recommendations: Findings from this study illustrate how Black teachers in general, and Black male teacher-coaches in particular, serve as the gatekeepers and guardians of Black intellectual thought within predominantly non-Black secondary schools. Participants who were secondary social studies and literature teachers resisted a White-controlled epistemic order that marginalizes Black intellectual thought. These findings have direct implications for secondary preservice teachers with the desire to courageously enact fugitive pedagogical practices to include diverse, antiracist curricular materials.

ID AMERICAN MALE TEACHERS; SCHOOL; MASCULINITY; ISSUES
AB Recent scholarship on male teachers across several national contexts has investigated the dilemmas of hegemonic masculinity for male educators while only recently beginning to examine race as a mediator of masculinity politics in teaching. Conversely, an emergent body of work on Black male teachers has centred analyses of race and culture, but has yet to explicitly question Black male teachers' relationships to hegemonic masculinity. Drawing upon critical analytic perspectives from Black masculinity studies, this article explores how 11 Black male teachers in an urban, predominantly Black school district in the USA negotiated popular discourses that position Black male teachers as father figures for Black students. By delving below the surface of these discourses, this article identifies a complicated set of Black masculinity politics that may shape the experiences of Black male teachers, and that warrants further consideration by educational researchers, teacher education programmes and urban school districts committed to preparing and supporting Black men in the teaching profession.

AB Purpose - There is very little research of Black male mathematics teachers from African countries teaching in the USA, specifically, their preparation and teaching experiences. The purpose of this study is to shed light on three Black male mathematics teachers from two African countries teacher preparation and teaching experiences in three African countries and the USA.teachers.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a qualitative narrative research design to examine the teacher preparation and teaching experiences of Black African male mathematics teachers.
   Findings - The results of this study reveal that the Black African male mathematics teachers participated in traditional and alternative teacher preparation programs that were unique to the African countries. The results also revealed that these teachers saw their teacher preparation program in the USA as preparing them to teach in this context. The results also revealed that all three of the teachers' experienced success teaching struggling learners and English language learners mathematics in African countries and the USA.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to a small participant pool of three Black African mathematics teachers that cannot be generalized to other Black male teachers. There needs to be more research of Black male mathematics teachers, in general, and those from other countries, specifically. There also needs to be more research of Black male teachers' teaching practices that are successful with Black students as well as English language learners.
   Practical implications - Based on the study findings, policy-makers and stakeholders interested in recruiting and retaining Black male teachers and specifically, in mathematics needs to expand conceptualization and definitions to include those from other countries.
   Originality/value - This results of this study add a valuable contribution to the research of Black male teachers, in general, and mathematics, in particular. It expands conceptualizations of who constitutes a Black male teachers in the USA.

AB This article draws from data in a larger qualitative study on the lives of black male teachers in US public urban schools. I examine their schooling experiences as black male youth. By coupling theories of social suffering with life history methodology, this research analyzes how three black male teachers experienced frustration, marginalization, and misery as students. For these participants, academic tracking was a site of social suffering. This suffering persisted into their adult lives as classroom teachers, as they witnessed and attempted to mitigate the struggles of their own black male students. The findings in this study have implications for further research on black male teachers as well as their recruitment and retention in US public schools.

AB This study examines teachers of Black male students in a United States secondary school setting. Qualitative methods were used to document teachers' ideologies of and practices with their Black male students. In general, teachers drew upon competing structural and cultural explanations of Black male social and academic outcomes, while also engaging in practices that contested school barriers for Black males. Teacher beliefs about and practices with their Black male students were inconsistent in many ways, yet their agency on behalf of Black males might be understood as essential to Black male educational progress.

AB Black male teachers tend to enact culturally relevant pedagogical practices that support the academic achievement, cultural competence, and critical consciousness of Black male students. Using critical race theory, culturally relevant pedagogy, and life history methodology, we explore the life history and work of a Black male middle school teacher to examine ways in which his historical, societal, institutional, and communal and personal experiences have shaped him to become a culturally relevant teacher and advocate for Black male students. In doing so, we provide implications and recommendations for preservice teacher education programs to retain and better support Black male middle school teachers.

AB In 2015, the National Goals Conference for and with people with intellectual disability encouraged the field of special education to recruit and retain more Black teachers. In this grounded theory study, 18 Black men were interviewed to learn more about experiences surrounding recruitment and retention in special education teacher-preparation programs (SETPPs) and for teaching careers in special education. Findings led to the development of a theory based on three constructs: (a) motivations for becoming a special education teacher, (b) attractions to SETPPs, and (c) focused strategies for recruitment and retention that indicated several strategies that SETPPs and school divisions should consider (e.g., funding, distance education program, mentorship) when attempting to recruit and retain Black males into training programs and for special education careers. The implication for the special education teacher workforce and potential for future research are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to characterize the last decade of Black male teacher empirical research. The present study aimed to elucidate the most salient themes, commonalities, and departures in the literature on Black male educators. A quantitative content analysis was performed to systematically characterize the research trends present in this line of inquiry. The data were collected using an inductively generated coding scheme. A sample of n = 31 studies were identified and examined from articles published between 2006 and 2016. Then frequency data were computed to characterize the data under investigation. The study results indicate that Black male teacher research is nuanced and burgeoning, despite several lapses in article production. The results of this study contribute to the literature on Black male teacher recruitment, retention, and experiences by providing a survey of current research trends that suggest areas of strength, as well as challenges warranting further consideration.

TI Exploring the transition experiences of one black male refugee
   pre-service teacher at a HBCU
SO JOURNAL FOR MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Refugee; Black male teacher; Historically black college and university;
   Teacher diversity
ID STUDENTS; SCHOOL; UNIVERSITIES; NEEDS
AB Purpose - There is limited discussion in the teacher education literature about the experiences of pre-service black male teachers generally and the ethnic diversity among black male pre-service teachers specifically. Thus, this paper aims to explore the experiences of Frank, a black male refugee health education major attending an historically black college and university (HBCU).
   Design/methodology/approach - This research study is theoretically guided by selected tenets of Bush and Bush's (2013) African American male theory and Goodman et al.'s (2006) transition framework and uses a qualitative approach to explore Frank's transition experiences when coming to America, attending college and engaging in his student teaching experience.
   Findings - Frank experienced some difficulty transitioning to America, as a result of not having a strong financial foundation. During his college transition, Frank believed that the HBCU environment was nurturing; however, he encountered numerous ethnocentrically charged hostile confrontations from US-born black students at his university because of his accent. While he had some disagreements with the US education system in terms of discipline, Frank believed that his accent served as an asset during student teaching.
   Originality/value - This study adds to the burgeoning research that explores the intersectional identities among pre-service black male teachers. As we argue in this paper, researchers, policymakers and practitioners cannot treat black male teachers as a monolithic group and must contemplate the unique supports needed that can attend to the racial and ethnic needs of black male teachers.

AB Drawing from a conceptual framework grounded in Black critical theories, this qualitative case study explored the youth knowledge that two Black Male social studies teacher-coaches serving in urban Catholic high schools acquired through Black counterpublics to reconceptualize the ontological limitation of Black existence. Findings demonstrated that it was within civic spaces generated within the Black family and community that participants acquired the socio-cultural knowledge to see through antiBlack forms of White projection.

AB For years, policymakers, districts, and scholars have pushed for the inclusion of more Black male teachers in US public schools; however, their even smaller subset-Black male special education teachers-has been ignored, particularly by scholars. The results of this study provide insight into the recruitment and retention of Black male special education teachers as the author interviewed 10 of them on what factors impacted their decision to enter the field and assume the roles they did. The results highlight that these teachers have had a parent who was a special educator or mentor who aided their decision, and they often assume the role of a tutor or father figure, particularly for Black boys in their schools. Implications for research and practice are also discussed.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine three black African male mathematics teachers' preparation, teaching experiences, why they chose to become teachers in a diverse school district, the successes and challenges they faced and the impact of a same race and gender peer mentoring program on them.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used collective case study methodology to better understand three black African male mathematics teachers' experiences in a same race and gender peer mentoring program and their professional experiences.
   Findings - The results illustrated that all of the black African male mathematics teachers had experiences predicated on their race and gender. The same race and gender peer mentoring program helped black African male mathematics teachers to receive proper induction into the school district, navigate their schools and district and help create an environment to support their retention in schools and the district.
   Originality/value - This study adds to the growing body of research on black male mathematics teachers and sheds light on how the same race and gender programs help to retain them in the profession and their schools.

AB Educational stakeholders often recruit male teachers of color as solutions to the problems facing Black and Latino boys and young men in PreK-12 schools. However, given the assumptions made of these teachers' role in the lives of boys of color and their disproportionally low presence, few studies have considered what boys themselves report as missed because of the absence of Black and Latino male teachers. This case study drew from the voices of five Black and Latino adolescent boys in one urban secondary school in the United States to theorize what the participants missed (e.g. yearned for connections, reflections of self) and missed out on (e.g. seeing positive images of men of color) by not having a more robust presence of Black and Latino male teachers of color or misters. Findings indicated the need for boys' voices in advancing nuanced recruitment and retention discourses for their male teachers of color.

AB In this article, life history methodology and principles of counterstorytelling are used to examine moments when one Black male preservice social studies teacher and three Black male social studies teachers challenge Black masculinist visions of leadership, and moments when they seem complicit in perpetuating these visions. Findings indicate that these educators' understandings of Blackness, maleness, and the pursuit of Black masculine recognition are fluid, developing and sometimes contradictory. We argue that while necessary across disciplines, interrogations of Black masculinity are uniquely imperative in social studies teacher education due to how assumptions about Blackness and maleness have shaped struggles for Black civic recognition.

TI "Playing school": Creating possibilities to inspire future Black male
   teachers through culturally relevant play
SO JOURNAL FOR MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Early childhood education; Black boys; Black male teachers; Culturally
   relevant teaching; Imaginative play
ID PRETEND PLAY; EDUCATION; COMMUNITY; CHILDREN
AB Purpose - Much of the extant research literature on the initiatives to attract, inspire and recruit Black males to the teaching profession has focused on middle and high school students. Black boys' socialization into dominant narratives regarding who can and cannot become teachers occurs as early as in early childhood classrooms; however, little attention has been given to ways to attract, inspire and recruit them to the professional teaching ranks where a paltry 2 per cent are Black men.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper explores the concept of imaginative play experiences with respect to Black boys and unearths possibilities for future Black male teachers through culturally relevant play.
   Findings - Based on findings from the literature, this conceptual paper makes connections between the early childhood play literature and the Black male teacher recruitment and retention literature to create possibilities to inspire Black boys to enter the teaching profession.
   Originality/value - This paper presents a nuanced integration of imaginative play and culturally relevant pedagogy with specific attention to Black males.

AB National data trends underscore the "problem" of Black male achievement. Beneath the causes and consequences are the ideologies used to frame the problem and its solutions. The ideology of meritocracy is routinely employed to rationalize educational disparities. This article examined how White male teachers, in a charter school designed to promote academic success among Black boys, made sense of boys' academic achievement patterns. Interview analysis revealed the persistence of meritocracy, as teachers (a) located the problem within Black boys' identities; (b) constructed race, masculinity, and social class as barriers to students' academic success and teachers' effectiveness; and (c) positioned themselves relationally away from their students and the problem itself. We discuss implications for the academic development of Black boys.

AB Fostering a sense of civic engagement is considered an essential purpose of social studies education. However, given the ways in which formal civic curricula and standards decenter the impact of racial membership on civic status, Black teachers are turning to alternative, out-of-school sites to enact critical approaches to teaching civics. Interscholastic athletics serves as one locale for such revisionist practices. This multiple case study troubles the centrality of Whiteness and deficit notions within the teacher-coach discourse by explicating the civic practices of five Black male teacher-coaches who served in schools that were not predominantly Black. Drawing on a conceptual framework rooted in Black critical theories, their civic mindedness of coaching ideologies and civic-oriented activities fostered a sense of liberatory fantasy while immersed within an anti-Black milieu.

DE black queer male teachers; the closet; urban education
AB While black queer educators could conceivably play a critical role in disrupting black queer marginality in educational settings, relatively little is known about their experiences. Drawing upon findings from a broader qualitative study on black male teachers in an urban school district in the United States, this article explores how five black queer male educators negotiated pressures to keep their queerness 'in the closet.' Although remaining in the closet left these men vulnerable to homophobic surveillance, it also enabled them to demonstrate racially mediated forms of agency within school settings. By complicating constructions of the closet as an abject social positionality for queer educators, this article considers the possible affordances of the closet for black queer teachers while also underscoring the need for institutionally sanctioned interventions against homophobia in urban educational settings.

TI Locked in Glass Classrooms: Black Male Special Education Teachers
   Socialized as Everything But Educators
SO TEACHER EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION

AB This qualitative study of 10 Black men who teach special education found that they experience their socialization into the profession by school leaders and other system-level influencers as both challenging and conflicting. Although past research demonstrates that Black men who teach special education face pressure to engage in noninstructional roles, especially as disciplinarians and sports coaches, the impact on their school work experiences has not been examined. Study findings show that participants experience a conflict in role that creates a "glass classroom" distinct from the glass ceiling and the glass escalator. The barriers of the glass classroom make school experiences difficult because others do not see Black male teachers' potential for other meaningful school-based assignments. Thus, their opportunities are constrained. The study uses Wingfield and Chavez's racial inequity and occupational outcomes and role socialization theory as conceptual frameworks. Implications for practice and research are provided.

AB In this paper, we utilize the concepts of racial knowledge and subjective understanding to demonstrate how the metaphor of surrogacy encodes a racialized discourse via the epistemic authority of social science research. Taken together, we demonstrate how the pervasive use of surrogacy as a metaphor reflects the subjective understanding of Black male teachers produced through the racial knowledge of social science discourse. We argue that the metaphor of surrogacy has become so unquestioningly ubiquitous throughout education and popular culture that it has become the default conceptual framework regarding all reforms for Black young men and boys.

AB Despite the growing population of Latino students, little has been done to recognize the potential cultural assets and resilience that Latino communities and Latino teachers can bring to the educational environment. Using Critical Race Theory, in this article, each participant shares their experiences with their Black mentors. This article shares the ways in which Black teachers continue to exemplify Black teaching excellence now with a group that isn't Black.

AB One urban district administered the Black Male Teacher Environment Survey (BMTES) to each of its Black male teachers to measure their school-based experiences. This article highlights descriptive statistics from the 86 Black male teacher respondents. Findings suggest that participants' background characteristics and school-based experiences varied by the number of Black men on the faculty. Loners, schools with one Black male teacher on the faculty, reported different experiences when compared with Groupers, schools with four or more Black male teachers on the faculty. Specifically, Loners were more likely to receive alternative certification, reported that their White colleagues had greater influence on school policy than teachers of color, believed that being Black caused people to fear them in their schools, and reported having a greater desire to leave their schools than Groupers.

ID MALE TEACHERS; ISSUES
AB There is a lack of Black male teachers working with young children in early childhood education (ECE). This qualitative research investigated 23 Black male participants' beliefs about challenges to recruiting Black males to teach in ECE (birth-fourth) and recommendations to increase the number of Black males in ECE. Black masculinity identity theory was used as the lens to understand the sociocultural context participants provided. From the data, several themes emerged from participants' experiences: challenges to recruitment (i.e., presence, financial, and systematic obstacles in society) and recommendations for change (i.e., recruitment, alternative approaches, encouraging educational paths, and valuing personal interaction).

AB This article uses a phenomenological approach to explore the organizational dynamic of boundary heightening for 27 Black male teachers, across 14 schools, in one urban school district. Black male teachers described being perceived by their colleagues as either incompetent or overqualified to teach their subject matter. These experiences created workplace environments in which participants felt alienated from their colleagues. In response, these Black male teachers strategically erected social boundaries to manage interactions with their colleagues. Black male teacher diversity campaigns in education preparation programs should be informed by Black male teachers' school-based experiences. The article shows how teacher education programs can redesign facets of their preparation to attend to the boundary-heightening and workplace experiences that Black male teachers may face in becoming teachers of record.

AB The academic achievement of Black boys in the U.S. has been declining, and Black male mentorship can positively change these outcomes. Schools have tried many interventions to help Black boys receive the academic, social, and emotional support they need to close the performance gap. Some case studies have proven that Black male mentorship works. Bobby J. Rodgers Jr. and Devery J. Rodgers examine Black male student academic performance and propose Black male mentoring as a solution that offers promise in closing the performance gap.

AB Teacher education programs in the United States (U.S.) struggle to prepare teachers to meet the complex needs of elementary and secondary students in public schools especially those of color, those living in poverty, and those whose first language is not English. In this article, we argue for focused attention on preparing educators to teach African American male students as these students face particular institutional challenges in successfully navigating the U.S. public school system. Drawing from the significant body of research on teacher education and teacher learning for equity and social justice, four Black teacher educators discuss challenges they have faced in classes designed to prepare teachers to teach Black male students. Through an analysis of commonalities in their experiences, they propose means for teacher educators to foster greater understandings of the heterogeneity found among Black male students so that teachers can craft more responsive and responsible educational experiences for Black males.

AB Calls for the recruitment and retention of more Black male teachers have unfolded amid popular depictions of Black men as patriarchal disciplinarians. Against that backdrop, this article investigates how 11 Black male teachers were positioned as disciplinary agents in a predominantly Black urban school district on the east coast of the United States. As they described the discipline-related expectations they encountered in their jobs, study participants critiqued and complicated prevailing perceptions of Black male teachers as authoritarian disciplinarians for Black students. Through careful analyses of participants' narratives, this article offers new insights into how Black male teachers negotiate their roles as disciplinarians, and it raises several questions that could drive future efforts to understand and support Black male teachers' disciplinary practices in today's urban schools.

AB Black and minority ethnic teachers are significantly underrepresented in British schools. Despite increasing anxieties about Britain's 'diversity shortage' among teachers, recent studies on the experiences of Black teachers generally, and Black male teachers specifically, remain rather sparse. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 Black Caribbean and Black African male teachers with five or more years of experience in London schools, this article deploys Bourdieusian conceptions of organizational habitus to explore the ways in which the national 'diversity shortage' can lead to a local 'diversity trap' in state schools that limits the range of roles Black male teachers are encouraged to pursue in schools. Findings suggest that pressures for Black male teachers to serve in racialized roles as community liaisons, role models, and school-wide disciplinarians, particularly for ethno-racial minority students, have stymied the long-term progress of Black male teachers towards departmental and administrative leadership - ranks at which the diversity shortage is even more acute.

AB Increasing the number of Black men teachers and single-sex schooling options have been heralded as necessary to reverse trends in the failure of US education institutions to adequately educate Black boys. Too little research interrogates Black men teachers' interactions with Black boys for how they might reinforce anti-oppressive conceptions of race, gender and sexuality. A genre study - the multidimensional, intersectional examination of social identity to explain one's persistent dehumanization - was utilized to investigate how Black men teachers' interactions with Black boys shape the boys' understanding of Black manhood and masculinities. Regardless of schooling arrangement, findings suggest Black men teachers must recognize and disavow hegemonic gender logics in interaction efforts aimed at improving Black boys' lives. Additionally, I argue the potential of Black men teachers' interactions with Black boys to function as sites for reimagining Black boys' humanity in ways that counter persistent messages of their inferiority and disposability (i.e. aniblackness).

AB In the United States, scholarship on antiracist teaching in teacher education abounds. Extant research irradiates how antiracist pedagogues practice antiracist teaching and how students respond. The link between antiracist pedagogues' teaching and lived experiences, particularly with anti-Black racism, is under-scrutinized. This article theorizes antiracist teaching through the experiential knowledge of a Black male teacher educator. It sketches his theorizing of antiracist teaching, illustrating how that theorizing-which is anchored to his lived experiences with anti-Black racism-shapes his provocative pedagogic posture. Implications for antiracist teaching practice and research are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prior research shows that many teachers feel ill-equipped to deal with students experiencing loss, and teachers of Black male adolescents, in particular, sometimes mistake grieving for misbehavior. This multimethod case study investigated the way teachers and their Black male students at a single-sex school related around encounters with loss. We examined students' and teachers' grief experiences through stories that were shared during qualitative interviews and focus group meetings and by observing everyday interactions throughout the school building. Additionally, a survey was distributed to the senior class and school staff asking respondents to report their experiences with loss, grief, and relational support. We found that both groups shared a desire to forge relationships for grief support and that both students and teachers also felt their emotional needs were unacknowledged at times. We also documented many successful moments when the strength of a personal bond between student and teacher eased the pain of a significant personal loss. In this article, we argue that specific relational strategies, as outlined within the model of relational teaching and learning, can be effective for supporting students through periods of grief and can, in turn, also positively impacts teachers' own recovery from loss. Furthermore, we propose that school psychologists can play a critical role in supporting the relationship building between students and teachers, particularly in under-resourced schools without enough mental health personnel.

AB In the majority of public schools across the nation, Black male youth are undergoing what can be deemed as "educational genocide" - the killing off of any chances for an equitable education. This dramatically decreases opportunities for Black male youth to develop into fully participating citizens in a democratic society. In many ways, race is the silent killer because it is frequently masked. Preservice teachers often take their cue for how to treat Black male students from existing stereotypes about Black males and media representations of them. In this article, we argue for the development of racial literacy in preservice teacher education programs as a pedagogical method to mitigate the misreading of Black male students in teacher candidates' fieldwork experiences and subsequently in their future classrooms. Our argument operates from the premise that in a time when diversity, multiculturalism, and inclusion are more widely recognized than ever before, the notion of race, and popular education films that depict race, still influence how teacher candidates view Black male students, and race remains a predictor for how these students experience school.

AB The purpose of this qualitative research study was to understand how a Black male experienced the interview process while seeking a teaching position. The participant and I attempted to answer how race and/or gender played a role in his interviewing experiences. The researcher used a qualitative approach to interview this individual. Data analysis revealed major findings contributing to this Black male's interviewing experiences: Racism played into the hiring process in subtle ways, and just because this candidate was prepared to teach, that preparation did not guarantee his employment. The findings from this narrative account might prove helpful in understanding why there is currently a shortage of Black male teachers.

AB In this article we consider the implications of using popular visual media as a pedagogic tool for helping teachers acquire critical sociocultural knowledge to work more effectively with students of color, particularly Black males. Drawing from a textual analysis (McKee 2001, 2003; Rose 2001) conducted in the critical visual studies tradition (Barthes 1977; Hall 1993, 1997) and longstanding discourses on Blackness, Black masculinity and critical visual studies, we explore how the critically acclaimed HBO series, The Wire, positions Black males in the local and larger social milieu. While offering a more complex rendering of the Black male, The Wire simultaneously presents a myopic representation of the Black man and his place in the larger Black community. This inquiry highlights the pedagogic limitations of using The Wire, or any other visual media that reinscribes deficit-oriented knowledge that critical multicultural teacher education seeks to challenge about Blackness and Black people.

ID AMERICAN MALE TEACHERS; ROLE-MODELS; WOMEN TEACHERS; SCHOOL;
   RECRUITMENT; PEDAGOGY; ISSUES
AB Background/Context: Over the past decade, a growing chorus of educational stakeholders has called for the recruitment of more Black men into the American teaching profession, casting these men as ideal surrogate father figures for Black youth who may lack adult male role models in their families or communities. Although a small body of scholarly work has begun to examine the gendered forms of culturally relevant pedagogies enacted by Black male teachers, critical analyses have yet to emerge on how these men negotiate the gendered power dynamics and professional culture of a traditionally female workplace.
   Focus: This article presents several sets of findings from a more broadly framed study on the identities, pedagogies, and experiences of Black male teachers. Using Black masculinity studies as a conceptual framework, this article focuses specifically on Black male teachers' negotiations of workplace gender politics with women colleagues and administrators.
   Participants: The 11 Black male teachers whose narratives are explored in this article were middle or high school teachers in a predominantly Black urban school district on the East Coast of the United States.
   Research Design: The study described in this article was grounded in life history narrative inquiry and employed a three-interview regimen for in-depth interviewing to enable participants to construct rich and nuanced narratives of their lived experiences as Black men and as Black male teachers. Focus groups also allowed participants to co-construct understandings of the challenges and opportunities they faced as Black men in the teaching profession. Transcriptions were coded and analyzed for recurrent themes within each participant's narrative as well as across participant narratives.
   Findings: Participants' life narratives revealed patriarchal gender ideologies that produced an inattention to male privilege, fueled conflictual encounters with women colleagues and administrators, and informed a desire for more male-centered spaces and interactions within the profession.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: Patriarchal gender ideologies contributed to contentious gender politics in the workplace for the men in this study. Future research should attempt to develop deeper understandings of how these ideologies may influence the experiences of Black men throughout the American teaching profession. Additionally, inquiry efforts should explore strategies for engaging Black male teachers in examinations of their complicated relationships to patriarchy and for applying a critical awareness of gender to their negotiations of gender politics in the workplace.

AB Research has consistently shown that Black boys experience opportunity gaps in the American public education system. Beyond disproportionate outcomes in academics and behavioral outcomes, Black boys have less access to mental health support and may experience heightened symptoms due to systemic inequities. Despite many hypotheses, few explanations account for the lived experiences of Black boys. Research indicates that positive student-teacher relationships may increase academic, mental health, and behavioral outcomes for diverse learners. An exploration of the teacher-student relationship that centers the voices of Black males is needed to understand how to best develop a school culture that promotes the well-being of all students. This paper explores Black middle school male students' perceptions of the student-teacher relationship. Participants included 12 Black boys in a public middle school in two urban districts in the Midwest. Students identified the need to be recognized as individuals, the need for warm, authentic relationships to feel connected to the school environment and acknowledge that racism is a barrier to student-teacher relationships and the overall sense of connectedness. These findings have potential implications for fostering better student-teacher relationships, thereby impacting students' well-being, identity development, and addressing the student achievement gaps for Black boys.

AB Given limited scholarship examining gender dynamics in interactions between Black female students with Black male teachers, it is important to interrogate how Black girls experience teaching and learning in classrooms with Black male teachers in order to create culturally relevant caring (CRC) environments that nurture this student population. By centering the students' perspectives, this study examines perceptions of care when a race-match but gender-mismatch is present in the classroom. Using CRC as a conceptual framework and analytic tool, this qualitative case study investigates the significance of gender and race in establishing CRC in classrooms. Findings suggest that a lack of attention to gender fluidity and diversity within the Black female population can hinder the establishment of CRC.

AB The disproportionate discipline of Black male students is a pervasive problem in U.S. schools. To examine the role of stereotypes in disciplinary disproportionality, pre-service teachers were randomly assigned to read a vignette about a defiant student. Those who read a vignette about a Black student believed that the student was more likely to misbehave in the future, compared with those who read a vignette about a White student. These findings suggest that some teachers attribute the misbehavior of Black male students to more stable causes, which may lead them to alter their behavior toward these students.

AB This study examines the impact of the zero-tolerance policies on Black males' educational experiences and outcomes. Individual interviews were conducted with Black males who dropped out of high school. Using counter-storytelling within a critical race theory framework, Black males discussed the influence of the zero-tolerance policies on their school experiences. These men's narratives affirm that these policies created an inhospitable school environment and poor student-teacher relationship. Furthermore, school personnel's use of the most punitive measures of the policies, suspension and expulsion of students, led to their school failure.

AB Purpose This paper aims to examine how a Black male teacher made sense of the ways racism and white supremacy function in schools and constrains his practice by addressing the question: How does a culturally relevant Black male teacher engage a racial perspective in his pedagogy and make sense of the socio-political context of his practice? Design/methodology/approach This qualitative case study draws its data from semi-structured interviews and participant observations and was situated within a transfer high school in the Northeastern region of the USA. Findings This study elucidates the ways in which a Black male teacher's racial literacy enabled him to make sense of the socio-political context of his school, the profession and help his Black male students negotiate how they are racialized in schools and society. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on critical Black male teachers by forwarding a framework that helps us to understand how they engage in transformative work within assimilationist educational spaces.

AB Nationwide, school districts struggle to recruit and retain Black males to the teaching profession. As a result, the presence of Black male teachers is lacking in public schools, which impacts the overall student outcomes for all children, particularly Black boys. Such recruitment and retention becomes even worse at the early childhood level, which explains the paucity of Black male teachers who are early childhood educators. To date, only 2% of teachers are Black males, of which most are middle and high school teachers. Furthermore, the clarion call for Black males to become teachers does not often prioritize Black male teachers who are culturally relevant. In this article, we focus on educational research regarding the lack of diversity of teachers and among males in K-12 to provide recommendations to the field of early childhood education, with specific attention to recruiting and retaining culturally relevant Black male teachers in early childhood education.

AB While there continues to be increasing research about Black male teachers' school-based experiences, there is less empirical evidence on the variation in these experiences for this subgroup. Drawing on Kanter's Theory of Numbers and Group Composition, the researcher used the qualitative method to compare the perceptions of Black male teachers in schools that employ just one Black male teacher versus schools with larger numbers of Black male teachers. A theory of social isolation in organizations is proposed to explain differences in the variation of school-based experiences for Black male teachers. When compared to Black men in schools with larger percentages of Black male teachers on the faculty, those Black men who were the only Black male teachers on their faculty were more likely to describe feeling socially isolated and disconnected from their colleagues.

AB In this study we followed a qualitative case study design to examine the perspectives of 20 school stakeholders (e.g., district and school administrators, school board members, teachers, school counselors, parents, staff, and advisory board members) regarding (in)equitable ways they promote and broaden the participation of Black male students in a high school academy of engineering. Using the concept of cultural matching and the formation of STEM identities, we understood that Black students at Madison River Academy did not participate in rigorous academic programs (e.g., the academy of engineering), partially due to a lack of the school stakeholders' abilities to provide culturally congruent, compatible, responsive, or synchronized learning environments that connected them with their home cultures and lived experiences. Findings from our case study demonstrate how the change in the historical mission of career academies has limited access to rigorous STEM opportunities and engagement of ethnically and racially diverse (particularly Black) students. In this academy, the lack of Black male student and teacher representation as well as mathematics were two barriers limiting the engagement of Black male students. Thus, we contend that it is critical that STEM academy school stakeholders, particularly school leaders, prioritize equity as a strategic goal for their STEM programs and recruit Black teachers who are willing to create culturally responsive curricular experiences to elicit interest in STEM for Black students.

AB The recent deaths of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and other Black males have generated new civil rights urgencies in Black communities and spirited academic discourses in higher education regarding the educational and social plight of Black males in America. Connecting the deaths of Black males to our lived experiences in the academy, we use a text messaging performative writing style to demonstrate how Black males are not only gunned down in the streets of America by police but also are metaphorically gunned down in the academy. That is to say, white colleagues and students attempt to use what we call the bullet of rejection, the bullet of silencing, and the bullet of disrespect to destroy us and our academic agenda. We conclude with a call to action for teacher education programs as a way to deepen their understanding of the racialized experiences of Black males in the academy and Black males in America.

AB Previous studies examining male elementary general music teachers have treated this population as a homogeneous group, ignoring or downplaying the social differences that exist among male teachers. This study considered how gender intersects with other identities, such as age, race, and sexuality, to impact the experiences and self-perceptions of three male elementary general music teachers. The three men purposively selected to gain a broad perspective included a late-career Black teacher, a middle-career Hispanic teacher, and an early-career White teacher. Each teacher was interviewed, observed in the classroom, and asked follow up questions via email. Data were collected over a three-month period and analyzed through the generation of emergent themes. Results revealed that these male general music teachers had a number of common experiences that might be attributed to their gender minority status in the workplace. Common themes included consciousness of the ways physical contact with students could be misconstrued and dismissal of the idea that they face stigma for choosing elementary education. Divergent experiences and self-perceptions could be explained by age, race, teacher identity, and sexuality. Their experiences and self-perceptions sometimes confirm and sometimes contradict previous scholarship, which demonstrates the need for more nuanced studies of this population.

AB In this article, the authors explore the analytic connections between the scholarship on Black teachers and the development of the concept of critical pedagogy. In particular, the authors conduct a detailed analysis of both of these discourses and then explore the work of two African-American male teachers in an urban school in Los Angeles. The findings reveal that the links between critical pedagogy and the scholarship on Black teachers is stronger than the existing literature would suggest. Additionally, it is suggested that Black male teachers in urban communities embody qualities outlined in both critical pedagogy and the scholarship on Black teachers.

AB Black males leave the teaching profession higher than any other demographic. Additionally, there is a paucity of literature detailing what it will take for schools to retain and develop Black teachers according to Afrocentric epistemologies. Using Teacher Life Stories and Psychology of Black Success to ground the research, I explore my journey to success as a former elementary music teacher in an urban school educating high populations of Black and Brown students labeled incompetent. Findings from a 9-month autoethnographic study support the creation of a new critical autoethnographic (m)ode of research to story and analyze teachers' positioned perspectives, (re)frame research and practice by attending to what is critical to researcher and participants through analysis of in-class interactions, and agentively (re)position lived experiences within broader historical and political contexts. If successful, critical autoethnographic (m)odes will foster much-needed wellbeing paths for writing and righting successful careers of teachers of color in education.

TI Reclaiming the Conveyor Belt: Physical Education Teacher Education as a
   Pipeline to the Professoriate for Black Males

AB There is a plethora of scholarship concerning the lack of academic achievement among Black males in the United States. Within higher education, this lack of achievement is represented as the difficult matriculation of Black males through their undergraduate experience and their lack of representation in the doctoral pipeline. The lack of representation has been explicitly documented within physical education teacher education and kinesiology scholarship-having been framed as the extinction of Black professionals in our field. Despite the ongoing deficit research about Black males and education, the purpose of this article is to present a framework for the recruiting, sustaining, and supporting of Black males to the professoriate through physical education teacher education. We utilized our personal experiences in a Black male doctoral pipeline to detail how physical education teacher education can be leveraged to mentor Black males within the field and others.

AB There is a shortage of Black men pursuing and or entering the pre-K-12 teaching profession. Some of the causes for the lack of Black men in the teaching profession stems from burnout, the school-to-prison pipeline, bad experiences as students, and a myriad of other reasons. We believe that Black men having a criminal record has not been fully explored or brought to the forefront as a major issue amongst the teaching profession and teacher preparation programs. To highlight this issue, we highlight and center the experience of one Black male who wanted to become an elementary reading teacher but was unable to due to his criminal record via a case study approach and a layered textual analysis. Specifically, we investigate what inspired a Black man's interest in pursuing a teaching career and what factors altered or contributed to his deviation from pursuing the teaching profession. We then offer suggestions for research, practice, and policy with hopes that these suggestions provide teacher preparation programs and the teaching profession at-large with tangible tangles goals and task to address the Black male shortage in the pre-K-12 profession.

AB Black male teachers make up less than 2% of the U.S. public school labor force. A prevalent discourse among educational stakeholders has suggested that Black male teachers are the key to helping students in urban schools develop skills to succeed in school by acting as role models. This assertion presents Black male teachers as a panacea to improving urban schools while ignoring the historical and contemporary contexts that complicate their roles in schools. This study uses life history methods to access the narratives of a group of Black male teachers to shed light on their experiences working in urban classrooms. The purpose of this study is to broaden our understandings about teacher education, teaching, and teacher retention of Black male teachers.

AB The ratio of Asian American teachers to Asian American students is the most disproportionate of all racial groups, where Asian American students are least likely to have an Asian American teacher. In addition, little research focuses on the experiences of Asian American teachers, particularly in connection with issues of racism. Using AsianCrit, internalized racism, and stereotype management, this study investigates how Asian American male mathematics teachers conceptualize their racial/ethnic and mathematics teacher identities given the prevalence of the Model Minority Myth. Using photovoice interviews, findings indicate that participants experienced internalized racism and engaged in stereotype management by distancing themselves from other Asian Americans, discussing their own difficulties in mathematics, and actively reaching out to form relationships with Black and Latinx students. We recommend supports for Asian American teachers and all teachers of color to build critical consciousness to reduce internalized racism and empower themselves and their students.

TI A Tale of Two Types of Schools: An Exploration of How School Working
   Conditions Influence Black Male Teacher Turnover
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English

AB Context: Ongoing teacher diversity campaigns will not increase the net number of teachers of color if policymakers fail to address the disproportionate rate at which teachers of color leave the profession when compared to White teachers.
   Purpose: The purpose of this article is to fill the empirical gap about the mechanisms that influence Black male teacher turnover. Specifically, this study explores the perceived school-based experiences of Black male teachers, with particular attention to comparing the experiences of Black men who are the only Black male teachers in their schools to those of Black men in schools with multiple Black male teachers.
   Research Questions: 1. In what ways do the school-based experiences differ for Loners (Black male teachers in schools employing only one Black male teacher) versus Groupers (Black male teachers in schools with larger numbers of Black male teachers)? 2. How does a school's organizational context, such as relationships with colleagues and school administration, affect the decisions of Loners and Groupers to stay in their schools or in the teaching profession?
   Research Design: This study employed a qualitative method, phenomenology. Two waves of semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with Black male teachers (N = 27) across 14 schools. Seven schools had three or more Black male teachers on the faculty (n = 20), and seven schools had one Black male teacher on the faculty (n = 7). Each semistructured interview lasted approximately 60 minutes.
   Findings/Results: Groupers cited challenging working conditions (such as weak administrative leadership) as their primary reason for wanting to leave. The following academic year almost half of these teachers (9 out of 20) did not return to their schools in the positions they had held the previous year. Counterintuitively. Loners, despite sometimes having hostile interactions with their White colleagues, stayed. While Simon and Johnson theorized that the absence of positive collegial relationships increases turnover, this phenomenon proved less true for Loners' decisions to remain at their schools.
   Recommendations: Given that Groupers were more likely to leave when compared to Loners, policymakers who are interested in increasing the number of Black male teachers must also give attention to retention. Future research should compare the school-based experiences and influences of turnover of Black male Loners and Groupers to other ethnoracial minorities, such as Latinx and Asian teachers. Practitioners, or specifically principals, may also want to become more attentive to interpersonal relationships in schools, particularly between Black male teachers and their White colleagues.

AB Objectives: Research has identified academic disidentification as a phenomenon that appears to uniquely impact Black male students. However, few empirical studies examine what underlies such gender differences. This study examined whether students' teacher trust is a factor underlying academic disidentification in Black college students and whether this is moderated by gender. Academic disidentification was investigated by examining the strength of the relation between a student's view of his or her academic abilities in comparison to peers (i.e., academic self-concept [ASC]) and the student's academic outcomes (i.e.,grade point average [GPA]). Attribution theory was used as a lens to test a hypothesized multigroup path model that linked age to teacher trust and ASC, and ASC to GPA through teacher trust. Alternative models were also tested. Method: Participants were 319 Black students (120 males and 199 females) recruited from a large, southwestern, predominantly White university. Results: Results revealed the hypothesized model fit the data reasonably well, whereas the alternative models resulted in a poorer fit. The final model supported our hypothesis that the relation between ASC and GPA is partially mediated by teacher trust and this relation was moderated by gender, such that the indirect effect was significantly stronger for males than females. Several significant differences were also found across gender for direct paths. Conclusions: These findings suggest college students' trust of faculty may be particularly important for Black males and is likely a contributing factor to academic disidentification. Practical implications for university professionals' facilitation of Black college students' academic development are discussed.

AB What we know about the experiences of black teachers is limited, especially considering the vast amount of research conducted on and about black boys and young men. This article describes and analyzes how a black teacher at a suburban high school in the Midwestern United States negotiated professional relationships through culturally relevant discourse. Anthony Bell was the only black male teacher participating in a classroom discourse analysis study group at a diverse suburban high school. Throughout the course of the semester, Anthony's stated objective for learning discourse analysis was to understand, structure, and facilitate more productive conversations with a struggling student teacher he was mentoring. Yet Anthony also used his discursive inquiry to trouble the water in his classroom and in the study group workshops. Participation in the study group provided Anthony with metalinguistic tools to critique his interactions with his students, student teacher, and professional peers. Anthony's analyses of his own teaching, his student teacher's work, the study group, and the school index themes in critical and critical race theory in education. As he became a teacher researcher, Anthony reported a greater sense of professional self-efficacy, eventually facilitating a successful workshop at a national teacher conference. Anthony's case is an exemplar of the unique and critical role of black men who teach, as well as the imperative of practitioner research within the current climate in teacher education.

AB Within schools across the nation, disproportionality in school discipline policies and practices continues to impact many racially and ethnically minoritized (REM) students. To combat the detrimental implications of discipline disproportionality, systemic changes to policies, practices, and accountability for teachers and school staff are required. Additionally, more culturally responsive social-emotional learning programs and interventions intended for Black males are needed to teach and promote culturally relevant prosocial behaviors. The current study sought to collect evidence from leading experts regarding the cultural validity of a culturally enriched social skills program for Black male adolescents titled Black to Success (B2S). Feedback from experts was integrated into the B2S curriculum to foster effectiveness and appropriateness for Black male participants. Results suggest that experts agreed or strongly agreed that the ten social skills and instructional strategies within B2S were important and culturally relevant, and included activities that promote positive racial/ethnic identity development of Black adolescent males.Impact Statement Feedback from school psychologist with expertise in social skills, racial/ethnic identity development, and culturally responsive adaptations to interventions for Black male adolescents enabled modifications to improve the cultural relevance and effectiveness of a culturally enriched social skills program for Black male adolescents. Such interventions are needed for Black adolescent males to promote culturally appropriate prosocial behavior and help Black males navigate the systemic barriers such as discipline disproportionality found within schools. Impact Statement Feedback from school psychologist with expertise in social skills, racial/ethnic identity development, and culturally responsive adaptations to interventions for Black male adolescents enabled modifications to improve the cultural relevance and effectiveness of a culturally enriched social skills program for Black male adolescents.

AB Despite the assertion that due to an Obama presidency America has become a post-racial society, Black males still face a unique social crisis. In this article, we hold that both race and gender continue to work in tandem to produce a certain set of social outcomes for young Black men in America despite this assertion. The educational, economic, and social mobility of young Black men is often limited due to structural constraints that are exacerbated by the intersectional dynamism of race, gender, and social class. As young Black men continue to experience social hardships, they are being pushed further and further away from traditional school contexts. Drawing from qualitative interviews with 24 young Black male participants from EmpowerYouth, a national community-based organization, this study highlights the importance of alternative sites of education and youth development for Black male youth. Findings from this study indicate that flexibility, applied educational and work experience, and positive healthy adult-youth relationships provided by EmpowerYouth, granted solace for young Black males who traversed through difficult circumstances within traditional school contexts. Our findings speak to the need to create new and relevant educational models that address the unique and complex circumstances of young Black men in America. Ultimately, as young Black males are often considered to be social burdens, this study shows how successful community-based programs like EmpowerYouth reframe young Black males as a valued segment of society that deserve support, care, and educational sites that are able to respond to their distinct academic and social needs.

AB This article examines how 18 teachers, counselors, administrators, and support staff from seven New York City public high schools collaborated during the Black and Latino Male Professional Development Initiative (a pseudonym) to develop a "culturally relevant, schoolwide, college-going culture" supportive of Black and Latino males' college readiness and access. We draw from a mixed-methods empirical research study to discuss participants' changing understandings of the features of such a culture, and how participants' action plans illuminate steps for change in their schools. We provide recommendations for creating equitable educational opportunities for Black and Latino males supportive of access to postsecondary education.

AB Black men have remained largely absent from the educational discourse on teachers and teaching. Even more important, their perspectives have not been fully considered in the debates over what constitutes culturally relevant classroom practice. In this article, portraits of the teaching lives of three Black men who worked as full-time teachers in urban schools in California are drawn. The portraits outline the teachers' entree into teaching, their views on pedagogy, and their culturally and racially sensitive pedagogical practice.

AB In this research article, Christopher J. Cormier analyzes interviews he conducted with five Black male US special education teachers to understand how they experienced social ties in the workplace. The interviews reveal the raced and gendered dynamics that complicated the interviewees' relationships with their predominantly White and female colleagues and how these Black male teachers chose to forgo social activities with their White colleagues even while knowing that this avoidance could limit their opportunities for broader career advancement.

ID CERTIFICATION
AB Many Black men interested in special education careers enroll in alternate route special education programs over traditional preparation programs. However, there is little research that focuses on their reasons for choosing special education alternate route programs and what makes these programs an effective choice for Black men pursuing teaching careers in special education. This qualitative study interviewed Black men regarding (a) reasons they chose an alternate route special education program, (b) core components of the program they found effective, and (c) support needs once they exited programming. Several themes emerged from this study and indicated that funding, targeted recruitment, and mentoring from Black faculty were among important factors for recruitment and retention. Recommendations for the field, implications and recommendations for policy and practice, and future research are also discussed.

TI Black Otherfathering in the Educational Experiences of Black Males in a

SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD

DT Article

   FRAMEWORK; PORTRAIT; IDENTITY; GENDER; BOYS
AB Background/Context: A good deal of research has been written about the problems and challenges facing Black male youth in their educational endeavors, ranging from academic performances, aspirations, and outcomes to student-teacher relationships, social experiences, and identity development. Statements calling for more Black male teachers abound in current educational discourse, and a number of studies have focused on their experiences in teaching, their pedagogical practices, and their role within the school setting. However, little attention has been given to how Black male students experience their learning and relationships with Black male teachers-the very people who are supposed to benefit from this adult presence. The present study investigates Black male students' experiences with Black male teachers at a single-sex urban secondary school.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand Black male students' experiences in an all-male learning environment, with a particular emphasis on the role of Black male adults in their schooling experiences.
   Participants: This study focused on the schooling experiences of 20 college-age Black males who all attended the same single-sex public high school.
   Research Design: Qualitative research methods were used in this study. In particular, data from in-depth interviews explored students' narratives about how they experienced and made meaning from the all-male schooling environment.
   Findings: Findings suggest that the students conceptualized adult Black males at their school as otherfathers based on their pedagogical practices, care and concern, and support. First, students expressed their need or desire for male teachers in their secondary schooling experiences. Students identified Black male adults as significant contributors to their development. Second, learning from Black male teachers was valued highly by students because these experiences provided them with insider perspectives and key insights on being Black and male. Students were exposed to opportunities to learn about how race and gender could matter in their lives. Finally, engaging with Black male adults in their schooling experiences provided students with unique opportunities to learn more about themselves. Students' learning enhanced their critical consciousness and connected to their racial and gender identities as well. Students attributed much of their success and personal development to how Black male teachers engaged in otherfathering-expressed as holistic care, support, parenting, modeling, and life coaching.
   Recommendations: Implications and recommendations for educational researchers and practitioners to better understand how Black males matter in the lives and schooling experiences of Black male youth are discussed.

AB Purpose Black and Latino males face challenges to college-going that may alter their decision to attend college. However, many Black and Latino males have successfully enrolled and matriculated through college. This study aims to explore the precollege factors that influenced the college enrollment and persistence for first generation Black and Latino male collegians (N = 5) at a predominantly white institution located in the Northeastern area of the USA. Two major themes (i.e., pre-college barriers and pre-college facilitators) along with several subthemes emerged from the data. The authors discuss recommendations for teachers, school counselors, and administrators in assisting Black and Latino males prepare for enrollment and persistence in college. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approached was used for this research study. A focus group was incorporated because it enabled participants to discuss their experiences in a single setting with other participants with similar backgrounds and thus through contrast and group dialogue vital insights related the phenomena of interest can be identified (Kitzinger, 1995). Individual interviews were conducted to engage in a more in-depth data collection process with the participants in a one-one-setting. Findings Pre-college barriers and pre-college facilitators were the major themes of this research study. The subthemes originated from the frameworks of Community Cultural Wealth (Yosso, 2005) and Constellation Mentoring (Kelly and Dixon, 2014). Originality/value The paper will contribute to the research literature, as the authors are exploring the experiences of Black male collegians from a Northeastern PWI. There is a dearth of literature in this area of research.

SO EDUCATIONAL STUDIES-AESA

ID PUBLIC PEDAGOGY; POLITICS; MEN; MANHOOD; BOYS; ART
AB This article explores how Black male teachers in Hollywood films continue to be encoded with meanings derived from deficit social science discourse generated through a white-controlled epistemic order. Drawing from the framework of critical public pedagogy and utilizing the critical visual cultural tradition, we contend that the representation of Black male teachers on film is rooted in longstanding conceptual narratives of Black men and boys. Findings indicate that cinematic films both develop their scripts around and contextualize the necessity of Black male teachers within deficit sociological tropes of absent Black fathers and their endangered sons.

AB The present study investigates and identifies the factors that contribute to the academic success of African American males in a historically Black university. Understanding how some African American males succeeded academically might help to inform educational officials about the strategy to assist struggling African American male students. The study was an investigation of lived experiences and motivating factors for the academic success of 10 participants. The findings offer African American males, especially those falling behind academically, an opportunity to discover strategies, tools, and approaches for being academically successful. The findings also indicated that social support, especially familial support, was essential to the academic success of African American males. Other contributing factors were the positive influence of teachers, mentors, and peers, as well as resilience perceived by the participants.

   Enacting Critical Race Care as Youth Mentors
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD

ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN; EXPERIENCES; CONTEXTS; SCHOOL
AB Background/Context: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of student engagement programs intended to increase college access, retention, and graduation for Black and Latino males. Although supporting Black and Latino male students' educational opportunities and success efforts is an urgent need, few studies examine their collective leadership experiences-either on campus or in the community. These experiences are important in understanding how engagement and leadership are vital components for Black and Latino males' sense of self, community ties, and collective consciousness. Focus of Study: We investigate the collegiate experiences and engagement of 12 Black and Latino male students in the Brothers Empowering Collective Achievement (BECA; pseudonym), a male-centered program at a Hispanic-serving institution. We explored their leadership and mentoring experiences through the following research questions: (1) How do Black and Latino college men make sense of their engagement in a male-centered success program? (2) What factors influence Black and Latino males' decisions to serve in a leadership capacity as youth mentors? (3) What is the focus of Black and Latino males' leadership work as youth mentors? (4) What do Black and Latino males take away from their experiences as youth mentors? Intervention/Program/Practice: The BECA program is an academic and social engagement program that was developed in an effort to increase graduation and retention of Latino and Black men. BECA provides professional workshops, one-on-one and small group mentoring, community service opportunities, and various other social activities. In addition, strategic partnerships with local schools allow college students to mentor middle and high school students. Research Design: This qualitative study is based on focus group interviews with 12 Black and Latino male students at a Hispanic-serving institution related to their leadership experiences as youth mentors for local middle school and high school students. Findings/Results: Our findings show that students were nested in, benefited from, and enacted critical race care-expressed as holistic care for youth, which considers their racialized identities and experiences as well as various facets of their lives in supporting their needs and development-through their BECA engagement. According to the men's narratives, BECA provided a unique opportunity to bring Black and Latino males together to pursue individual and collective goals. In addition, serving in leadership roles as youth mentors within the local community enhanced the men's sense of self and allowed them to contribute to community education and youth development. Conclusion/Recommendations: This study speaks to the value and benefits Latino and Black men accrue from critical race care. Specifically, being engaged and embedded in a community in which they pursue collective educational and personal goals enhances engagement, leadership, and relationships for Black and Latino college students.

TI "Ain't I a Teacher?" A Television Analysis of Black Male Media-Teachers
   on <i>The Steve Harvey Show</i>
SO SPECTRUM
LA English
DT Article
ID NUMBERS
AB Depictions of American educators in fictional television programming are often less professional and more contradictory than their real life counterparts. Leslie Swetnam's (1992) study explored media distortions of the teacher image. Swetnam's findings revealed a number of media-teacher demographic characteristics and stereotypes. The current research extends Swetnam's study by examining the presence of her media-teacher stereotypes and Jackson and Dangerfield's (2004) five factors of Black masculine positionality in the characters of Steve Hightower and Cedric Robinson on the American television series The Steve Harvey Show. The analysis determined that the television representations of both characters incorporated familiar themes associated with Swetnam's media-teacher demographic characteristics, teacher stereotypes, and Black masculinity traits. Additionally, the study revealed an overwhelming emphasis on the romantic pursuits of Steve Hightower throughout the 50 examined episodes, presenting criteria for a new media-teacher stereotype: the suave, emotionally indifferent, romance-driven teacher.

TI Boyz to men? Teaching to restore Black boys' childhood
SO RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Black; male; education
AB Many schools see teaching African American boys as a daunting challenge. However, in many schools the primary focus of Black male children's educational experience is maintaining order and discipline rather than student learning and academic achievement. By the time Black boys reach the 3rd or 4th grade their teachers and other school personnel no longer treat them like children, but rather like men. This paper will describe the current state of education for Black male students and propose ways to ensure that we teach all children, particularly Black boys in intellectually, socially, and culturally appropriate ways.

AB In this study, we examine how race and racism impact the schooling of African American males by analyzing the first-person perspective of hip-hop superstar, Nasir "Nas" Jones. We selected Nas due to his unique yet prevalent educational trajectory and perspectives. Critical race theory is employed as a framework as well as notions of Sankofa methodology and literary analysis to investigate his music, documentaries, and an open letter whereby he critiques the public school system while providing academic ideas to engage and inspire Black students. Studies about Black males routinely focus on their subpar academic performance with the intention of "correcting" these behaviors. We utilize the experiences of Nas to reframe the conversation and provide nuanced insight into Black educational experiences instead of perpetuating recycled, bleak narratives. This article concludes with suggestions for educators to better serve African American males in the Pre K-12 academic context.

AB This study describes the experiences of fourteen Black male principals or heads of school navigating racialized spaces, including the politics of race, and experienced racism in educational settings as well as in school leadership. Data analysis utilized a critical race theory (CRT) and culturally sensitive methodological and interpretive framework. The data analysis revealed themes associated with identity scrutiny, right to lead, meritocracy and color evasiveness, all falling within the white gaze paradigm. However, the results also suggest a demonstrable pathway for Black leaders to successfully navigate the pitfalls of the white gaze and experienced negative professional and personal reactions to this phenomenon. This self-developmental journey is marked by increasing self-awareness, self-efficacy and a growing Black identity. A developmental model is proposed which could be deployed to coach and develop these school building-level leaders and accelerate the learning curve. Thus improving leader's sense of positive well-being, leadership impact, while decreasing retention risks.

In addressing such concerns, my intention is not to discourage efforts to recruit and retain more African American men as teachers, but to trouble the commonsense assumptions embedded in such efforts. To achieve these goals, I draw from philosopher Ian Hacking's (1995) notion of "human kinds" to historicize the context in which Black male teachers emerged as possible role models for Black male students. To further illustrate this point, I draw data from interviews I conducted in a qualitative study. The Black male teachers cited in the interview section of this article provide a revised theorization of the dominant discourse about their practice. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of this work for ongoing concerns about the recruitment and retention of Black male teachers.

AB Black adolescent males use available mental health services at a disproportionately lower rate compared to males of other racial groups. This study examines barriers to school-based mental health resource (SBMHR) use among Black adolescent males, as a means of addressing reduced usage of available mental health resources and to improve these resources to better support their mental health needs. Secondary data for 165 Black adolescent males were used from a mental health needs assessment of two high schools in southeast Michigan. Logistic regression was employed to examine the predictive power of psychosocial (self-reliance, stigma, trust, and negative previous experience) and access barriers (no transportation, lack of time, lack of insurance, and parental restrictions) on SBMHR use, as well as the relationship between depression and SBMHR use. No access barriers were found to be significantly associated with SBMHR use. However, self-reliance and stigma were statistically significant predictors of SBMHR use. Participants who identified self-reliance in addressing their mental health symptoms were 77% less likely to use available mental health resources in their school. However, participants who reported stigma as a barrier to using SBMHR were nearly four times more likely to use available mental health resources; this suggests potential protective factors in schools that can be built into mental health resources to support Black adolescent males' use of SBMHRs. This study serves as an early step in exploring how SBMHRs can better serve the needs of Black adolescent males. It also speaks to potential protective factors that schools provide for Black adolescent males who have stigmatized views of mental health and mental health services. Future studies would benefit from a nationally representative sample allowing for more generalizable results regarding barriers and facilitators to Black adolescent males' use of school-based mental health resources.

AB Childhood play is foundational to early childhood education, yet teachers criminalize Black boyhood play in and beyond early childhood classrooms. It is noted in the extant research literature that early childhood teachers' stereotypes and biases of Black boys inform how they view their play styles and behaviors. These stereotypes and biases often lead to exclusionary discipline practices, namely Black boys' removal from play opportunities in early childhood classrooms. Given that childhood play is beneficial to young children's academic and social development, teachers' use of exclusionary discipline practices during play can exacerbate opportunity gaps between Black boys and their White counterparts. It can disrupt Black boys' opportunities for play and recreation in early childhood classrooms. However, scholars have understudied teachers' use of exclusionary discipline practices during Black boyhood play. Drawing on Black Critical Theory, anti-Black spatial imaginary, Black Male Studies, and employing a multi-case study design, we aim to explore teachers' use of disciplinary practices during Black boyhood play. The following research question guides this study: What exclusionary discipline practices do early childhood teachers use to restrict Black boyhood play? Findings suggest that teachers use what we term the three antiblack misandric restrictions of boyhood play, which include (a) restriction of time, (b) restriction of space, and (c) restriction of interactions.

AB This paper explores the educational journeys of three tenured, Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) professors who serve at public research-intensive universities as professors of education. We discuss how our journeys in and through Adventist education impact our pedagogy and offer insights that can be helpful to other Christian educators, students, and parents who would like to learn how to navigate a path to a career in higher education. The three of us could be described as somewhat of an anomaly in terms of our identities and positionalities as Black male Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) professors in public universities-yet we know that there are many other people from the neighborhoods and churches where we grew up who could be doing similar work but for various reasons did not get access to this opportunity. The goal of this critical trio-ethnographic paper is to offer a counter-narrative on Black male SDA education and possibilities, through our personal reflections and analyses of our educational experiences in SDA education that inform the way we engage our students now as SDA and culturally relevant teachers in public universities.

AB Using student-level administrative data from North Carolina, we explore whether exposure to same-race teachers affects the rate at which Black students receive exclusionary discipline, such as out-of-school suspensions, in-school suspensions, and expulsion. We find consistent evidence that exposure to same-race teachers is associated with reduced rates of exclusionary discipline for Black students. This relationship holds for elementary, middle, and high school grade ranges for male and female students, and for students who do and do not use free and reduced-price lunch. Although we find reductions in referrals for a number of different types of offenses, we find particularly consistent evidence that exposure to same-race teachers lowers office referrals for willful defiance across all grade levels, suggesting that teacher discretion plays a role in driving our results.

TI Race-Conscious Teacher Coaching: Disrupting Implicit Bias and Improving
   Teachers' Relationships with Black Students
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSULTATION

AB Racial discipline disproportionality is a persistent issue in schools with Black students experiencing exclusionary discipline two to three times more than their White peers, and Black males more likely to be diagnosed with an emotional and behavioral disorder. Interventions that target malleable root causes of disproportionality and have an explicit racial bias component may disrupt these processes. The study took place in an alternative school setting across two classrooms with White, fifth- and sixth-grade teachers (n = 2) and their Black students (n = 6). A single-case, withdrawal design (A-B-A-B) examined the impact of a semi-structured teacher coaching intervention on disrupting biases, improving classroom management and cultural competency, and ultimately improving student-teacher relationships. The coaching included Mindful STOP as a self-regulation strategy, the Mindful Reflection Protocol to discuss behaviors, and performance feedback, all focusing on outcomes related to student-teacher relationships and discipline. During intervention phases, Teacher 1 showed improvements in positive communication while keeping negative communication low. Teacher 2 showed smaller, more variable improvements. Teachers and students in both classrooms reported improvements in their relationships based on pre/post rating scales. Teacher-reported discipline outcomes were variable. These findings may provide concrete strategies for supporting the development of equitable discipline practices for Black students. Future studies will explore modifications to the current coaching package.

AB In this article, we chronicle two African American, male teachers' (fourth and fifth-grade teachers at the same school) use of Afrocentric praxis to demonstrate how the identities of African Diasporic students can be honored and sustained. We begin by explaining the conceptual framework and the context of the school and classrooms. We focus our gaze on the two teachers and Yandi, a second-generation immigrant child, because complex cultural identities are often forgotten and negated in school. We reflect on the pedagogical needs of Yandi as a student whose parents are first generation immigrants to the U.S. We demonstrate how layering the content of African-Diasporic people using Afrocentric praxis can serve as methods to actualize pedagogical love and can be used to engage and invite Black students whose parents are recent immigrants. We conclude with recommended resources.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine instructional and cultural supports that school stakeholders used to meet the needs of high school Black males participating in an academy of engineering. Based on interviews, three themes emerged: (a) representation matters-culturally responsive caring adults and role models; (b) teaching navigational life skills; and (c) targeted culturally responsive supports (or lack thereof). These factors promoted a culture conducive for engaging Black males and cultivated their success.

AB This study seeks to challenge the uni-dimensional way care in school is written about by highlighting an often overlooked aspect of care - the kind that students do for each other. Data is drawn from focus groups conducted with the youth participants and founder of Umoja Network for Young Men (UMOJA), an all-male, school-based mentoring program for over-aged and under-credited (OA/UC) high school students. The authors draw on theories of culturally relevant pedagogy, care, and critical pedagogy to present the findings and propose a form of culturally relevant care (CRC) that entails warm demanding and building mutual trust. This study highlights the humanizing experiences of the Black and Latino male transfer students and their mentor. This focus on the experiences of young Black and Latino male participants seeks to shift the discourse from one focused on deficits to one that recognizes their agency and capacities for social and academic success.

TI Plantation economy religion: Black male experiences with religious
   antiblackness in predominantly white conservative Christian schools
SO RACE ETHNICITY AND EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Anti-blackness; Christian education; Black males; Christian schools;
   Christian anti-blackness; religious education
AB Research about Black boys in predominantly white conservative Christian schools has centered on their racialized experiences. For Black males, these experiences have been traumatic because their white Christian teachers and classmates have demonstrated anti-black racism through the use of derogatory language, social exclusion, and stereotyping. Researchers have focused on this anti-blackness with little consideration for the religious environment in which these events transpired. Hence, this article aims to analyze the role religion played in the anti-blackness because these events do not happen in a vacuum but in a religious context. From this research emerged a religious approach that we termed Plantation Economy Religion that became the central breeding ground for the development and manifestation of anti-blackness. This religious approach created a complicit relationship between anti-blackness and religion, which manifested in a lack of physical and cultural representation during school worship and enabled people to weaponize religion through plantation economy theology.

AB Using the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS: 2002), this study investigates predictors of Black male students' educational attainment and bachelor's degree completion. Regression results showed that above and beyond the effect from socioeconomic status (SES), students' expectations and math teachers' expectations were statistically significant in predicting Black male students' educational attainment, and students' expectations was the only significant predictor of bachelor's degree completion. Independent sample t-tests also found significant differences between Black male students who completed their bachelor's degree and those who did not with regard to their expectations of academic achievement, teacher-student relationships, parental involvement and expectations, and influence of friends. Implications for K-12 and higher education are discussed.

AB Background:This study addresses the leadership of African American male leaders and their operationalization of the ethic of care in their practice by analyzing the educational leadership of African American men through an ethic of care lens.Purpose:The purpose of this article is to simultaneously remind readers of the importance of caring in schools, while discussing the caring styles of Black males in leadership.Research Design:This study examined the lived experiences of 10 African American male administrators to understand their perceptions of caring leadership. The phenomenon of interest was investigated using qualitative, exploratory study methodology to facilitate the collection of rich data that tells the stories of the participants. The themes discovered during the focus group were used during the one-on-one interviews to probe deeper into the issues and evaluate the consistency of the themes. Striking similarities that fit logically into themes emerged in the data from the focus group and the individual interviews.Findings:The themes that emerged from this study did not support the stereotype so often set forth regarding Black male leadership. The major emergent themes were:Black male leaders cared and liked being associated with caring, they felt they had to mask their caring nature because of societal expectations, they view themselves as father figures, they strongly identify and connect with a sense of spirituality, they believe that action must follow caring, and they practice "rough love" as care.Conclusion:The core foundational principles of Black Masculine Caring include a framework that acknowledges Black men have the capacity to care, and often care deeply. Black men's capacity to care depends on their prior experience as Black men. The caring exhibited by Black men is influenced by their culture, and caring demonstrated by Black men is often misunderstood or misinterpreted.

AB Recruiting racially minoritized principals is one suggested strategy to increase the racial diversity of teachers, who would then better match their increasingly racially diverse students. However, focusing solely on race ignores the salience of race-gender intersectionality in principal-teacher relations. Using three waves of nationally representative, cross-sectional data with school and year fixed effects, we compared similar teachers in the same school who are and are not race-gender congruent with their principal. We found that better discretionary workplace benefits were concentrated among Black teachers with Black principals, especially Black male teachers with Black male principals, who reported workplace supports almost half a standard deviation higher than did similar non-Black female teachers in their school. Male teachers earned up to $2,890 more supplemental income with male, racially congruent principals; female teachers earned up to $1,050 less with female, racially congruent principals. However, teacher turnover was not consistently responsive to race-gender congruence.

ID BLACK-MALE; EDUCATION; BOYS
AB In recent years mentorship has become a popular solution' for struggling boys of color and has led to the recruitment of more male of color teachers. While not arguing against the merits of mentorship, this article critiques what the author deems corrective representations.' Corrective representations are the imagined embodiment of proper and productive masculinities that male of color educators are asked to perform. This discourse perpetuates confining representations of identity and locates the problem of boys of color within their own actions. Designed as an ethnographic case study, this article explores the life of one Latino male teacher as he navigates discourses of corrective representation as coordinator of his school's Latino boys program. This project provides a detailed account of the cultural politics of Latino male mentorship and offers the notion of a critical borderlands approach to identity as an avenue to problematize essentialist and deficit approaches to Latino boys.

AB In this Voices: Reflective Accounts of Education essay, Esther O. Ohito con sid ers with Sherry L. Deckman how silence and silenc ing are expe ri enced cor po re ally in socio culturally situated spaces, foregrounding their affec tive con tours and mate rial effects in their explo ra tion of emo tion ally charged dia logues about race and rac ism in edu ca tional set tings. Building their nar ra tive around a Black male teacher can di date's expe ri ence in a social jus tice-ori ented teacher prep a ra tion pro gram, they reflect on the pres ence and effects of silence and silenc ing in that inti mate white space. The essay con cludes with implications for critical pedagogy relevant to the potentially transformative force of trans gres sive race talk that coun ter acts silence and silenc ing in white spaces.

AB Despite existing recruitment and retention efforts, there has been a persistent underrepresentation of Black men teachers in the U.S. educator workforce. The present study employed a phenomenological approach to examine what motivated Black men (n = 27) to enter the teaching profession. We drew on the social-cognitive career theory (SCCT) framework to analyze the most salient factors that Black men teachers referenced in their career decision-making processes. The results pointed to various factors contributing to Black men entering this profession including early experiences in education, role models, and exposure to ineffective classroom teachers. Our findings have implications for future research and policies related to the creation of teacher recruitment efforts and pipelines into the profession for Black men.

AB Background/Context: There is a growing body of research that conceptualizes mathematics learning and participation as racialized experiences; that is, learning experiences structured in part by the negative and unjust race relations that are present in U.S. society. However, the role racialized experiences play in the lives of Black elementary education pre-service students from urban contexts, as both students and future teachers of mathematics, is under theorized.
   Theoretical Framework: Using critical race theory's racial micro-aggressions and the development of a mathematics identity, the author explores the mathematics experiences of 13 Black advanced undergraduate students who are elementary education majors. The participants' narratives reflect their experiences as both students of mathematics and future teachers.
   Research Design: A qualitative phenomenological research design was used to explore the prior and current mathematical experiences of the study participants and their future trajectories as teachers of mathematics. Reponses were coded to reveal themes of racialization and the development of the participants' mathematics identities.
   Results: The participants' narratives cited Black male fathers and close male relatives as their first mathematics teachers, the presence of culturally affirming at-home mathematics activities, and detailed aspirations to teach mathematics fearlessly to their own children and future students. Their more recent experiences included academic struggles in mathematics, often stemming from racial stereotyping and non-affirming college mathematics teachers. Their voices suggest that, within the context of learning mathematics, they have generated self-constructions that include racism as part of their shared African American experience in mathematics schooling that have implications for their teaching of mathematics.
   Conclusion/Recommendations: Recommendations include the provision of professional development that targets gaps in mathematics that are the result of inadequate and discriminatory learning opportunities, and culturally sensitive professional development for mathematics college faculty, with differentiated training for mathematics faculty not born in the U.S. In light of the high proportion of Black teachers working in urban schools who face a host of difficulties, this research also supports the continued development of combatting racial micro-aggressions in mathematics education as a decisive tactic to improve the retention of Black elementary education teachers.

AB This article examines a culturally responsive mentoring approach, and how it is enacted and experienced by two Black women doctoral students in relation to their Black male faculty mentor. Autoethnography is used to examine these mentoring dyads. By examining, defining, and applying culturally responsive mentoring, authors reflect on meaning of being part of a mentoring relationship that boldly addresses race and racism in academe. The hope is that by presenting the power of these dyads we open a conversation that is a fruitful start to needed change in mentoring, which ultimately places significant responsibility for supporting Black scholars at the feet of institutions. Analysis of multiple identities brought to light four themes of mentorship: (1) critical consciousness/cultural competence/ cultural compatibility in mentoring relationships, (2) mentorship as a turning point, (3) multilayered mentoring as pivotal to growth, and (4) clarifying visions for the future through mentorship.

AB Teacher leadership recently has gained prominence as an important method for school improvement and reform, yet the ranks of teacher leaders do not match the racial and ethnic diversity of the students they serve. Jori S. Beck, KaaVonia Hinton, and Brandon M. Butler conducted a study of teacher leadership that garnered almost 800 survey responses and included 31 interviews with administrators and teachers. They discovered how the lack of diversity in the teacher workforce, the myth of meritocracy, and the isolation of teachers of color present barriers to diversifying the teacher leader workforce. Potential solutions include equity audits, revisions to hiring practices, and the distribution of teachers of color within school buildings.

AB This article examined general trends in teacher-reported conflict and closeness among 878 children from kindergarten through sixth grade, and examined early childhood characteristics that predict differences in initial levels and growth of conflict and closeness over time. Results indicated modest stability of teacher-perceived conflict and closeness through sixth grade, with relatively greater stability in perceptions of conflict. Levels of conflict at kindergarten were higher for children who were male, Black, had greater mean hours of childcare, had lower academic achievement scores, and had greater externalizing behavior. Children identified as Black and those with less sensitive mothers were at greater risk for increased conflict with teachers over time. Levels of teacher-reported closeness were lower when children were male, had lower quality home environments, and had lower academic achievement scores. The gap in closeness ratings between males and females increased in the middle elementary school years. Additional analyses were conduced to explore differences in teacher ratings of conflict between Black and White students.

AB This study explored the achievement, engagement, and school climate perceptions of African American males in urban high schools. Hierarchical regression and focus group interviews were used to analyze male sample (n = 114) data from a larger study. Findings suggest that students' perceptions were influenced by having information about and access to advanced placement (AP) courses, teacher patience and support, student-teacher relationships, and racial fairness in student discipline. Providing more information about and support in AP courses, ongoing cultural proficiency training, and investments in racially fair discipline systems are among the recommendations.

AB The purpose of this article is to describe a pedagogical inquiry the author conducted to engage preservice teachers in social justice praxis and teacher activism to address the impact of racial profiling on classroom interactions by utilizing the Trayvon Martin case. The Martin case provided the opportunity to have rich, meaningful discussions regarding race, equality, and justice with preservice teachers so that they would be better equipped to tackle such issues in the classroom. Most important, this inquiry reinforces the notion that children of color will never be treated equally until we change how they are perceived.

AB Advancing the literacy development of African American males in contexts that are characteristically urban has been a challenging task for educators across the P-12 spectrum. Frames that have been traditionally used to improve the reading achievement of African American males have not reversed trends in reading achievement that find many of these young males underperforming on traditional reading assessments. The purpose of this article is to reframe the discussion on the literacy development of African American males based on a review of several bodies of literature. Attention is given to evidence-based reading research: three historical frames of the literacy development of African American males and a literacy model for advancing the literacy development of African American male youth in urban schools. Finally, a research agenda is proposed for advancing the literacy development of African American male youth with the goal of offering guidance to teachers, teacher educators, researchers, and policymakers.

AB Despite the evidence implicating implicit racial bias in teacher decision-making as one reason for the overrepresentation of Black male students in school discipline practices, there is minimal research regarding interventions that address implicit racial bias in the school setting. A System 2 cue refers to a behavioral cue that engages more deliberate and controlled cognitive processes in decision-making and mitigates the impact of unconscious racial bias in decision-making, in contrast to System 1 processing which employs more automatic cognitive processes. This pilot study evaluated the use of a System 2 cue in teacher decision-making and included 361 practicing teachers. All participants read a vignette describing a Black male student's behavior and were then assigned to a control condition or the System 2 cue condition. Differences in teacher perception of troublesome behavior were analyzed with independent samples t test and likelihood of completing an office discipline referral was compared with binary logistic regression. Results indicate that addition of a System 2 cue predicted ODR likelihood, but perception of troublesome behavior was more predictive and explained the relationship between System 2 cue and referral likelihood. Further, we found differences in two aspects of troublesome behavior perception (i.e., level of concern and belief that the behavior will occur again in the future) for teachers receiving a System 2 cue compared to those who did not, preliminarily suggesting that some perceptions of troublesome behavior may be alterable through System 2 cues.

AB Classroom observations are the largest component of evaluation ratings given to teachers in the multiple-measure evaluation systems states have implemented in the last decade. Using data from the first eight years of Tennessee's teacher evaluation system, we document race and gender gaps in observation ratings and ask whether these gaps reflect true differences in instructional effectiveness. White and female teachers receive, on average, 0.15 standard deviations (SD) and 0.30 SD higher observation ratings than their Black and male colleagues. Gaps persist even conditional on other measures of teachers' effectiveness, such as value-added to student test scores or student attendance, consistent with potential bias. The Black-White gap is largest in schools where Black teachers are racially isolated and is partly explained by Black teachers' propensity to be assigned less advantaged students within their schools. Teachers receive somewhat higher ratings from raters of the same race. We find no same-gender rater effects and, beyond score differences associated with grade and subject taught, uncover few explanations for the large advantage women see in observation ratings. Our results suggest the need for steps to address bias in evaluation processes to ensure the accuracy of evaluation feedback and fair, equitable treatment of teachers in evaluation and staffing actions that rely on it.

TI Every Student Succeeds (Except for Black Males) Act

DT Article
ID CRITICAL RACE THEORY; MIDDLE SCHOOL; MATHEMATICS; EDUCATION; POLICY
AB In PreK-12 schools throughout the United States, Black male students are the most under-served and punished population. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) misleads Black male advocates and stakeholders into believing that it ensures they succeed. This article examines ESSA and its implications for educational equity for Black boys. Using critical race theory, the authors argue that, similar to past policies, ESSA intends to ensure educational equity for all students but ignores the ways in which race, gender and other forms of oppression are implicated in the teaching and learning process and constrain Black male youths' opportunities to learn. This article calls for culturally grounded and social-justice-oriented perspectives in the development of policies for Black male students.

AB In this autoethnography, I utilized the concepts of otherfathering, social capital, and testimonio (i.e., testimonial) to explicate the need for and value of Black male mentors in physical education teacher education (PETE). To do so, I describe how three of my mentors operated as otherfathers by imbuing me with the social capital needed to be successful in academia. I conclude by arguing for specific intersectional efforts to support Black men and Black women in PETE, along with the establishment of organizational efforts, to meet the needs of Black professionals in PETE.

   Academic Preparation for Postsecondary Success

AB Background/Context: Scholars agree that students' academic preparation for college begins as early as middle school. This preparation includes both instructional and social supports. The present study draws much-needed attention to how Black males articulate the role and function of their Chicago high school for helping them negotiate the challenges of urban living to both earn admittance to, and graduate from, a four-year college or university.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Not enough is known about the specific supports most useful for improving urban Black males' academic preparation to earn a baccalaureate degree from a four-year college or university. A single-sex public high school in Chicago (Nabur) rose to national prominence in 2010 for helping each of its 100% Black male graduates earn admission to college. This study investigates how members of this school's inaugural graduating class on track to graduate from college within 6 years of initial enrollment describe their high school academic experiences, and the impact of these experiences for shaping their college persistence. Exploring the contours of academic preparation through Black male students' perspectives can be instructive for improving urban school reform efforts aimed at better preparing them for multiple postsecondary options.
   Population/Participants/Subjects: Eighteen Black males-members of Nabur's inaugural graduating class who began at Nabur High School in 2006 and graduated in 2010-were participants in the study. Each of the young men, with the exception of one, attended Nabur all four years of their high school career. The young men self selected participation in the study. Each participant was on track to graduate from college within six years of their initial enrollment at the time of data collection.
   Research Design: The young men participated in one in-depth one-on-one interview. Instructional and social supports-dimensions of academic preparation explored in this study-help to frame analysis and presentation of the findings.
   Findings/Results: Students described teacher availability and academic expectations (instructional supports), as well as community building, social networking, and personal affirmation (social supports) as important aspects of their academic preparation for postsecondary success. Practitioners' beliefs about Black males' resilience as a framework for design and implementation of instructional and social supports emerges as most significant to their academic preparation for college.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications and recommendations for repurposing "struggle" as a site of resilience in efforts to better meet the unique needs of urban Black males in preparation for college are discussed.

TI African American male teachers in public schools: An examination of
   three urban school districts
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID BLACK EDUCATORS; RECRUITMENT; STUDENTS
AB Currently, African American students constitute approximately 20% of the public school population, while African American male teachers constitute 1% of the teaching force. In this article, the author presents the findings of a study that examined the disproportionate number of African American male teachers in America's K-12 public schools. More specifically, the researcher surveyed 147 African American male teachers in three urban school districts in Louisiana to better understand what strategies school districts could implement to increase the presence of African American male teachers. The recommendations are presented in this article.

TI Scripted Curriculum: What Movies Teach About Dis/ability and Black Males
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID DISABILITY; RACE; EDUCATION
AB Background/Context: Tropes of dis/ability in the movies and master-narratives of Black males in education and society are typically treated in isolation. Furthermore, education research on Hollywood movies has typically focused on portrayals of schools, principals, and teachers even though education professionals are exposed to a broader range of movies. Analyses of dis/ability tropes in the media also tend to ignore how they work in multiples and intersect with narratives of other social identities such as race and gender.
   Focus of Study: This article examines the complexity of portrayals of Black (dis/abled) males that are scripted through dis/ability tropes and master-narratives of race and gender. Trends in these portrayals are juxtaposed with literature on how Black, (dis/abled) male students are treated in schools and society.
   Research Design: Critical media analysis is combined with the social model perspective of dis/ability to explore the lessons that movies provide audiences about Black (dis/abled) males. This analysis of several movies produced from 1990 to 2012 is informed by critical perspectives from critical dis/ability studies (CDS), critical race studies in education (CRSE), and curriculum studies and scholarship on education, social science, and popular culture.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Data are drawn from major motion pictures produced and distributed nationally in the U.S. (1990-2012) that feature Black male actors in leading or major supporting roles characterized as having a physical dis/ability, impairment (restricted use of major limb or sensory organ), or a debilitating condition according to the Internet Movie Database. Data from media outlets and documents (movie scripts) support the analysis. CDS and CRSE, namely critical race theory (CRT), provide the theoretical framework.
   Findings/Results: The narratives of Black (dis/abled) males in movies are more complex than typically described. Rather than operating singularly, dis/ability tropes interpenetrate and intersect with master-narratives of race and gender to portray Black (dis/abled) males through a narrative of intersectional threat coded in themes of marginalization, dysfunction, and miscegenation. The findings are further nuanced through a discussion of the constructs of presence through absence, embodied patriotism, and racialized space in order to illustrate how Black (dis/abled) males' treatment in the movies echoes in how they are treated in schools and society.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Through an intersectional lens of critique directed toward all forms of cultural texts, educators can resist the normative conceptions that can orient their praxis in schools and society. Attention to how stereotypical narratives in film and education leave out a range of experience among Black (dis/abled) males can generate counter-spaces for a broader range of narratives.

AB Background/Context: The link between care and teaching is well accepted, and positive teacher-student relationships are known to benefit students' in-school experiences and academic success. Yet, positive teacher-student relationships are not the norm for African American males and African American male students' experiences and performance in schools remains an issue.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: What characterizes the teacher-student relationships within the all-Black, all-male classes of this district-sponsored program? Moreover, how do the instructors for the program enact these characteristics in their classrooms?
   Setting: This study examines a project of the Office of African American Male Achievement in Oakland, CA. The Manhood Development Program was an elective class in the high schools and an after school program at the middle schools that sought to improve Black male students' academic success and school experiences, and teach students about their cultural and community histories. MDP classes were offered to Black male students and taught by Black male educators.
   Population/Participants/Subjects: Based on support from and communication with the MDP facilitators and school administrators, the participants in this study include MDP instructors and their students at three high schools and one middle school within an urban school district where there are persistent, racialized disparities in rates of discipline and in levels of academic success.
   Research Design: This article reports on a qualitative case study of the teacher-student relationships within four classrooms that were part of a program for African American male adolescents within an urban school district.
   Data Collection and Analysis: During one academic year, four of the MDP classes were observed at least four times and videotaped at least twice. Interviews were completed with three of the class instructors and with 41% of students across the four classes. The observations and videos were analyzed for instances when teacher-student relationships were leveraged towards specific pedagogical ends. Micro-ethnographic analyses were conducted of the video instances to highlight the dimensions of caring exhibited in the teacher-student interactions. From these analyses, one interactional segment was chosen to illustrate the existence and nuances of a politically intentional form of caring.
   Findings/Results: The MDP instructors' sociopolitical consciousness impacts and shapes their relationships with their MDP students. MDP instructors articulate and enact specific goals around how to construct caring teacher-student relationships that stem from their intention to positively influence the lives of Black children, push back against the racialized and hegemonic institutional structure of schools. MDP instructors teach in a way that is fundamentally connected to the local community in Oakland and make a concerted effort to know, rather than stereotype, each student and to develop each students' full potential. These relationships are intentional, political, and visible acts of care by MDP instructors that are interactionally coconstructed within their classrooms.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This case of politicized caring questions the premise that education and schools are, and should be, narrowly focused on developing test preparation, career-readiness, or content-specific practices. Instead, this case illustrates the alternative educational ideologies and practices of four Black educators that allow them to reclaim their social and political responsibilities and create effective, nurturing, antiracist schooling environments for Black students. This microanalysis of one of these classes offers an example of a type of caring and pedagogy that currently exists and that could be more widely available to Black students.

AB In this article, we analyze the variation in math achievement trajectories of Black male students to understand the different ways these students successfully or unsuccessfully navigate schools and the school characteristics that are associated with their trajectories. Using longitudinal student-level data from a large urban US city (n = 7,039), we analyze Black male students from one cohort to identify trajectories. We find a lack of growth in standardized math scores, suggesting that, on average, math proficiency among Black male students in our sample is declining over time. We found that the 4th-grade standardized math scores of subsidized-lunch students were somewhat lower than those of nonsubsidized students and those of retained students were substantially lower than their counterparts. The average math score of a Black male student's cohort appears to be the only variable amenable to policy manipulation that has a sizeable association with the growth of their standardized math scores, suggesting that putting Black male students in more challenging learning environments may be the best way to increase math proficiency over time. By themselves, other policy decisions (reducing student mobility, teacher turnover, or special education classification; increasing attendance or spending on after-school programming; or hiring more qualified or experienced teachers) all appear to have no or negligible associations with growth in math scores.

AB This study examines student-teacher racial match for its association with Black student achievement. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to analyze 2013 National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP) Grade 4 Reading Assessment data to examine interactions of teacher race and student race in their associations with student achievement (N = 165,410 students, 23,710 teachers). Effects on Level 1 random slope parameters suggest that a match of Black male students with Black teachers is associated with higher reading scores for this group, as is a match of Black female students with a Black or Hispanic teacher. Level 2 effects suggest that greater classroom composition of Black males is associated with lower reading achievement. Moderation by gender and implications for educational policy are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study is to explore the direct, indirect, and total effects of high school sports participation on educational attainment for Black males using the Educational Longitudinal Study (2002/2006), a large, nationally representative, database. A path analysis procedure for determining underlying causal relationships between variables is presented. Although the implications of the results of this study are relevant for all who work with this population, school counselors are specifically highlighted.

AB Too often, instruction designed to improve literacy achievement for black male readers and writers focuses on skill-based learning, ignoring cultural, social, and personal development. This article calls for the use of critical literacy strategies with African American male students, which can raise expectations for academic achievement by challenging traditional notions of literacy instruction, encouraging cooperative learning, and allowing students to develop a sense of social justice. Three dimensions (the 3 Cs) of critical literacy for young black males are explored: culturally relevant texts, collaboration, and critical conversations. In addition, suggestions and examples are offered to help teachers create critical literacy experiences in which black male elementary students can have the opportunity to become socially conscious text users who see themselves and their cultural histories reflected in texts.

TI Coaching wellness, health, and success: Leveraging the potential of
   Black male coaches to promote positive outcomes for Black K-12 students
SO THEORY INTO PRACTICE

DT Article

AB While there are low percentages of Black males as educators, psychologists, pediatricians, and psychiatrists, Black students are more likely to have a Black male athletic coach. Previous research on the role of Black male coaches has demonstrated that there are several positive outcomes (i.e., academics, social skills, and reducing misbehaviors to deter criminalization) when the racial identity of Black students is matched with a Black coach. Black male coaches are an understudied cultural asset to the Black community. Therefore, this article explores how Black male coaches can be used to accelerate the closure of the opportunity gap by promoting community wellness, health, and academic success for Black youth. The recommendations for policymakers, educators, and school mental health professionals were written in collaboration with a Black male teacher-coach who works in a predominately Black high school setting.

AB This article examines the teaching philosophies of Blackmale teachers of Black male students in manhood development classes in a district-wide program in Oakland, California. Drawing on observations and instructor interview data, we explore the teachers' histories, teaching philosophies, and the trajectory of their racial-educational understandings. We utilize Gramsci's (1971) theory of the organic intellectual, Mills' (1997) and Leonardo's (2013) theories of the sub-person and substudent, and Dumas' (2014) notion of Black suffering to theorize the ways that race comes into play in the teaching of African American male students. We find that racialization and re-humanization are key to instructors' teaching, and we identify two key aspects of their teaching philosophies: (1) Humanization/Love and (2) Reciprocity.

AB The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a social emotional learning curriculum, Brothers of Ujima, for children at risk for being referred for placement in emotional and behavioral support classrooms. The Brothers of Ujima is a strength-based culturally relevant intervention for African American boys aged 10-14. The purpose of the 14-week program is to strengthen positive self-esteem, ethnic identity, and prosocial behaviors while reducing negative behaviors among boys. The curriculum objectives are for boys to critically assess myths and stereotypes of African Americans presented in the media, to help boys develop creative thinking and leadership skills, to increase appreciation of African and African American culture, and to learn adaptive coping skills when faced with discrimination. This study is the first to evaluate this curriculum in a school-based setting. Fourteen 6th- and 7th-grade students participated in the intervention. Results show that males demonstrated an increase in Afrocentric values, but not in racial identity or resiliency. Teacher interviews showed that the intervention was feasible for a school setting; however, modifications to format and lessons content should be undertaken for future studies.

ID ACHIEVEMENT; STUDENTS
AB The purpose of this research effort was to examine Black male students' self-perceptions of academic ability and gifted potential in science. The purposeful sample consisted of nine Black males between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Four categories of self-perceptions of academic ability and gifted potential emerged from the data. These included: (a) gifted high achievers; (b) gifted "could do better" high achievers; (c) gifted "could do better" situational nonachievers; and (d) gifted "could do better" underachievers. Science teachers' influences that referenced participants' academic achievement pointed to validation. Participants' perceptions regarding how science teachers' influenced their academic performance focused on science teachers' content knowledge. Power dynamics germane to Black male participants' value or worth that directed their efforts in science learning environments are discussed. Implications are posited for science teaching, science education programs, and future research. This research endeavor was based on two premises. The first premise is that Black males' self-perceptions of academic ability affect their science academic achievement. The second premise is that, given parental, peer, and community influences, science teachers have considerable influence on students' self-perceptions of academic ability. However, the focus of this research was not on parental influences, peer influences, or any potential influences that participants' communities may have on their academic achievement.

AB There is a long and persistent gap between the academic achievement of White and Black students in America's schools. Further, Black students are suspended from school at a rate that is more than three times greater than White students. While there has been some suggestion that perhaps teacher-student racial matching may be part of a solution, the research does not currently provide adequate support for teacher race alone to be sufficiently effective. This study analyzed 41 Black and White teacher-student dyad mixes in elementary schools and another 41 in a high school to examine how teacher and student race interact in terms of teacher and student behaviors. While Black students were slightly more likely to be off-task and disruptive, both Black and White teachers were found to provide significantly more negative feedback to Black students regardless of their behavior. Implications for teacher practice and future study are discussed.
   Impact and Implications
   This study found that Black male students are more likely to receive more negative interactions with their teachers, regardless of their behavior. Further, teachers of all ethnicities and gender were equally likely to interact with Black students in this manner-indicating that implicit bias affects all of us. This is clear evidence supporting the need to make educators aware of implicit bias and how it can affect instruction.

AB Background: Scholars have argued that far too little research has examined the complex processes that many Black males undertake in constructing identities that function in schools. Some have highlighted the perpetuation of a false dichotomy in which challenges, particularly for Black males, have focused on either individual or institutional culpability. Further, scholarship on Black males that has focused largely on deficits has neglected to include student voice to acknowledge the strategies employed by academically successful Black male students in the face of staggering challenges. The present study investigates academic identity formation with two high-performing Black male students attending an urban high school in Los Angeles, California.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Not enough is known about the sense-making process young, academically successful Black males go through in constructing identities that function in school settings. This study explores the complexity of academic self-concept between two academically high-performing Black male high school students through the conceptual and methodological tool of identity mapping. The study explores the following questions: What are the factors that two academically high-performing Black male students identify as being important to their academic self-concept? In what ways, if any, do identity maps provide descriptive information about the construction and performance of academic self-concept among these Black male students?
   Research Design: Drawing from Multiple Worlds Theory and the work of Cooper, Jackson, Azmitia, Lopez, and Dunbar, and Beach, Lundell, and Jung, this study utilized identity maps to visually represent participants' understanding of multiple aspects of their self-concept through overlapping or disconnected spheres (i.e., multiple worlds). Identity maps were then used as tools for interviews to better understand the academically high-performing Black males' academic self-concept.
   Findings/Results: Findings suggest that these two academically high-performing Black male students conceptualize their academic identities as socially situated in a myriad of unique ways. Identity maps became an effective tool for both capturing the sense-making process students us to describe highly contextual and complex notions of an academic self and highlighting tensions embedded in the way students identified with schooling.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications and recommendations for educational researchers and practitioners to make concerted efforts to better understand Black males' identity formation in school settings are discussed.

AB Background/Context: Black boys' schooling experiences in the United States are an important area of inquiry, given the ways they are systematically repositioned away from schooling success in dominant narratives about their lives. Scholars suggest that Black boys need to be cared for and nurtured in schools. However, few studies have explicitly explored their subjective experience of care. A cumulative understanding of the educational trajectories of Black boys suggests that their early experiences can influence later schooling years. This exploration considers the role of relationships and contexts across two distinct time periods of development in shaping their educational experiences. Purpose/Research Question/Focus of Study: In this study, we use a relational care framework to investigate how Black boys, during preschool and high school, make sense of their experiences of care within the school context. Based on their relationships with teachers, other adults, and peers, care is discussed through three important constructs: tangible care, time-related care, and personal support. The major questions we explore are: (1) In what ways do Black boys feel cared for in school? and (2) How does being cared for matter in their schooling experiences? Participants: This study comprises two groups of Black boys at different developmental stages. The first group comprised 11 Black boys enrolled in the same state-funded preschool program, and the second group of participants consisted of 20 Black boys who graduated from the same all-male, all-Black secondary school. Research Design: This qualitative investigation explored how Black boys (N = 31) make meanings of their school-based relationships. It was conducted across two distinct time periods within two separate studies, one during preschool and one during high school. Findings/Results: We found that Black boys at both stages of development place primacy on care through school-related relationships with teachers, other adults, and peers. The Black boys in this study delineated distinctions in the dimensions of care, source of care, and their perspectives of the care they received from peers and adults in school. Taken together, caring for others and being cared for were critical to the educational experiences and well-being of Black boys in this study. Conclusions/Recommendations: This research contributes to understandings of Black boys' school-related needs across two distinct developmental periods. As such, it is important for educators to see relational care as a vital tool for educational success of Black boys during the early years and continuously throughout their educational trajectories. Relatedly, educators must seek to incorporate care within the context of a relationship centered on a unique appreciation of each Black boy and his individual care needs, educational aspirations, and possibilities.

TI Examining Teachers' Beliefs About African American Male Students in a

SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD

AB Background/Context: The study examines teachers' and administrators' perspectives on the persistent academic failure of African American male high school students. The study took place between 2003 and 2005 in a low-performing high school in Summerfield County, a Black suburban county in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States with a poverty rate below 8%, according to the 2000 United States census. At the time of the study, there were a number of initiatives across the state designed to address what was being referred to as "the minority achievement gap." The researchers-most of whom were African American faculty and graduate students at the University of Maryland-were interested in understanding what teachers and other school personnel such as counselors and administrators would have to say about why African American students, particularly males, tended to persistently underperform on standardized measures of achievement, had higher rates of suspension and expulsion from school, were overrepresented in special education, and had significantly higher dropout rates than all other subgroups in this mostly Black and middle-class suburban school district.
   Purpose and Research Questions: In the present article, we build on the work of scholars of critical race studies in education and scholars concerned about teachers' impact on student achievement to explore teachers' beliefs about African American students, and we discuss the possible implications for African American males in troubled schools. We used critical race ethnographic methods to collect data on the following research questions: (1) How does a low-performing high school in a low-performing school district cope with the persistent problem of African American male underachievement? (2) In particular, how do teachers and administrators understand the problem? (3) How might this impact their ability to work successfully with African American male students?
   Setting: The study took place in Summerfield County, a majority-Black suburban county in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The county is known as the wealthiest Black county in the nation. With over 100,000 students, its school district is one of the largest and lowest performing in the state. At the time of the study, the district was ranked 23rd out of 24 districts in the state in measures of standardized achievement. The research took place in a midsized all-Black high school in a section of the county that is contiguous with one of the poorer sections of a nearby city. The high school, with a 99% Black population of slightly fewer than 1,000 students, was one of the lowest performing high schools in the district.
   Participants: The main participants in the study consisted of two groups: (1) a sample of 50 teachers, administrators, and counselors, and (2) a subsample of 6 teachers in art, music, technology, social studies, and math who participated in ongoing individual interviews, a focus group, and classroom observations.
   Research Design: This study involved a series of focus groups, formal and informal interviews with teachers, counselors, and administrators, and 18 months of ethnographic observations in the school.
   Conclusions: Researchers found that school personnel overwhelmingly blamed students, their families, and their communities for the minority achievement gap. In short, the school was pervaded by a culture of defeat and hopelessness. Ongoing conversations with a smaller group of teachers committed to the success of African American male students revealed that the school was not a safe space for caring teachers who wanted to make a difference in the lives of their students.

AB I examine productivity and selection effects of K-12 teacher tenure by leveraging variation from New Jersey's TEACHNJ Act, which extended the pretenure period. Using a difference -in -differences design, I evaluate the productivity effects of tenure by comparing fourth-year tenured and pretenured teachers. I find math valueadded declines but English language arts value-added and ratings remain unchanged. Focusing on labor market effects, I compare teachers hired before and after TEACHNJ within the same district and experience level. TEACHNJ disproportionately increased male and Black teacher turnover, as the policy was tied to subjective evaluation criteria. TEACHNJ did not impact the quality of the teacher labor market as measured by value-added, though higher rated teachers often filled new vacancies. This matches principal-agent models where schools only use ratings to guide personnel decisions. Overall, tenure generates small declines in math value-added, while reforms tied to subjective evaluations disproportionately increase male and Black teacher turnover.

TI Examining Organizational Practices that Predict Persistence Among

   STORIES; EQUITY; ACCESS
AB Background/Context: This article summarizes an increasing trend of antideficit Black male research in mathematics and highlights opportunities to add to the research. A review of the literature shows that antideficit researchers often examine relationships between individual traits and persistence of high-achieving Black males in mathematics. However, opportunities for additional antideficit research include examining relationships between organizational decisions and persistence of high-achieving Black males.
   Research Question: Which organizational practices predict persistence among Black males in 11th grade who have demonstrated high mathematics potential in ninth grade.
   Population: Data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) were used in this study to identify a national sample of high-achieving Black males. Publicly-available data from the base year (2009-2010) and the first follow-up year (2011-2012) were used in this study to examine Black male persistence in high achievement categories from ninth to 11th grades. The sample was limited to public school Black males with mathematics achievement scores in the top two national quintiles. More than 31,000 students (weighted estimates) met the study's requirements and were included in this study.
   Research Design: Using optimal resource theory (Anderson, 2015), logistic and multiple regression was used to examine the relationships between school-based practices in ninth grade and student outcomes in 11th grade.
   Findings/Results: Of the Black males who demonstrated high potential in ninth grade and matriculated to pre-calculus in 11th grade, 61% earned mathematics scores in the top 20%, nationally. Contrarily, only 18% of the Black males who demonstrated high potential in ninth grade, but did not matriculate to pre-calculus in 11th grade earned mathematics scores in the top 20%, nationally. Additionally, of the extracurricular activities that were exam-ined, findings show that partnerships with community colleges and universities, science and mathematics guest speakers, and science/math-related field trips were related to increased mathematics efficacy after two years. Teacher sorting practices and professional development activities that were examined in this study were not reliably predictive of student outcomes.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This study uses national data to demonstrate that some common organizational practices are more beneficial to high-achieving Black males than others. In particular, this study highlights the importance of developing course progress monitoring and support plans to increase the likelihood of persistence-future high achievement and beliefs about ability-for Black males who have demonstrated high potential in ninth grade. Opportunities for future research are also discussed.

AB Background/Context: Black people continue to be popularly imagined as lacking humanity and, as such, are often the disproportionate subjects of unceasing race-gender terror and state violence. A vast body of scholarship has documented the failure of schools to adequately serve Black youth in general, and Black boys and men in particular. There is compelling evidence, however, that consistently humanizing interactions with adults in school lead to positive relationships that in turn may protect against Black boys' experience of school as fundamentally dehumanizing. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study examined the significance of positive relationships between Black boys and adults in school as they move(d) across the P-16 education pipeline. The study is guided by the following primary research question: How do young Black men and boys describe and understand their interpersonal relationships with adults in P-16 schools? Research Design: A descriptive phenomenological approach was used to understand how 28 Black boys and young men discuss and describe the characteristics of relationships with adults in their school or university. Seven video- and audio-recorded focus groups were conducted. Data analysis occurred in three phases. Video clips from focus groups were analyzed in the first phase of data analysis. During the second phase of our data analysis, researchers employed critical race theory as a key analytic perspective to interpret the data for what they revealed about the ways anti-Black racism and white supremacy structured schooling experiences. The third phase of analysis centered on coding the entire data set, regardless of grade band, for three specific types of interactions: disciplinary/behavioral, social/relational, and academic. Findings/Results: Key findings from the study center on (a) these participants' keen awareness of the ways their words/behavior/actions are generally misread and misunderstood in U.S. society and (b) the significance of educators' race-gender perceptions of them in building positive relationships that establish and sustain authentic human connections. Conclusions/Recommendations: Human connection emerges over time and differentiates what our participants ultimately perceived as "good"/positive relationships from "bad"/negative relationships with educators. Recognition of the residual consequences of U.S. chattel slavery for the ways we see, know, and understand Black people and Black children is essential to cultivating positive relationships with Black boys. Although "bad" relationships are characterized by interactions reflecting racial misandry that Black boys come to expect as a normal, ordinary feature of their schooling experience, positive relationships are evidenced through consistently humanizing interpersonal interactions with adults that actively counter harmful racial scripts.

AB In what ways do the tragedies centered on the lives of black youth, particularly black male youth, inform teachers, education policymakers, and teacher educators about what knowledge is most worth knowing? In this counter/story, we will examine the details of the life and death of Trayvon Martin. From these details, we will extract and interpret a curriculum of tragedy that draws from Derrick Bell's particular contributions to critical race theory (CRT) applies its central tenets. This article will conclude with lesson for black education for teachers, education policymakers and teacher educators.

TI Mindful Discipline: A Pilot Study Exploring Mindfulness and the
   Reduction of Punitive Discipline for Black Male Students
SO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE implicit bias; mindfulness-based interventions; teacher education;
   racial disparities; school discipline
ID DISPARITIES; RACE
AB Racial disparities in school discipline are well known and widely studied. Studies find, for instance, that Black students in secondary grades experience the highest rates of exclusionary punishment compared with their peers (Losen, 2018). Despite what is known about the prevalence and causes of disparities, such as educator bias in discipline decisions, there is surprisingly little evidence about how to effectively shift these disparities in schools. This pilot study attempts to address this, exploring whether a brief mindfulness-based intervention for teachers may reduce the impacts of racial bias on their interpretations of behavior and subsequent recommendations for discipline after reviewing a vignette depicting a Black male adolescent. The effects of the mindfulness exercise on participants' interpretations and recommendations were examined through regression, and findings indicate a significant main effect of the treatment on both indicators. The preliminary findings of this exploratory study suggest that brief mindfulness training may help to reduce the impacts of racial bias on discipline decisions for Black students. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

ID CULTURALLY SUSTAINING PEDAGOGY; MULTILITERACIES
AB We explore how valuing Black male students' literacies within academic contexts during multimodal writing can position students' ways of knowing at the center of their learning. This centering requires a repositioning of students' cultural literacies at the core of instruction. Using multiliteracies and Critical Discourse Analysis frameworks, we analyze and share excerpts from conversations with three Black adolescent high school seniors as they composed and reflected upon authoring digital autobiographies for an assignment in their Black Literature class. These reflections illuminate how the students drew on culturally salient texts to share elements of themselves with their peer and teacher audience.

AB This study examines whether subgroups of Black youth exist based on the presence or absence of racial discrimination experiences in the school context and whether these groups varied by gender and household income. Latent transition analyses were performed on racial discrimination indicators derived when youth were in the 8th and 11th grades. Three distinct subgroups of youth emerged. Youth in the Teacher-Peer Perceived Racial Discrimination (PRD) group had a high probability of experiencing racial discrimination from both teachers and peers. Those in the Teacher PRD group had high probabilities of experiencing racial discrimination from teachers and a low probability of experiencing racial discrimination from their peers. Finally, youth in the No PRD group had low probabilities across all racial discrimination indicators. Males were more likely to be in the Teacher-Peer and Teacher PRD groups compared with females. Findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of Black youth's experiences as it relates to race-related stress and several avenues for future research are identified.

AB Purpose -This study aims to highlight the perspectives of one black male middle-school mathematics teacher, Chris Andrews, about developing black students' positive mathematics identities during his first year of teaching middle-school mathematics in a predominately black school. The author's and Chris Andrews' shared experiences as black Americans opened the door to candid conversations regarding the racialized mathematical experiences of "our" children, as he referred to them during the interviews.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author used case study methodology (Yin, 2009) to illuminate Chris's salient academic and personal experiences, approaches to teaching mathematics and ways that he attended to mathematics identity in practice. The author used sociopolitical and intersectional theoretical framings to interpret the data.
   Findings - Chris's perspective on teaching mathematics and developing mathematics identity aligned with taking a sociopolitical stance for teaching and learning mathematics. He understood how oppression influenced his black students' opportunities to learn. Chris believed teaching mathematics to black children was his moral and communal responsibility. However, Chris's case is one of tensions, as he often espoused deficit perspectives about his students' lack of motivation and mathematical achievement. Chris's case illustrates that even when black teachers and black students share cultural referents; black teachers are not immune to the pervasive deficit-oriented theories regarding black students' mathematics achievement.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings of this work warrant the need to take intersectional approaches to understanding the ways of knowing that black male teachers bring to their practice, as Chris's identity as a black person was an interplay between his black identity and other salient identities related to ability and social class.
   Practical implications - Chris, even while navigating deficit-oriented perceptions of his students, provides an example of bringing a sociopolitical consciousness to teaching mathematics and to support novice black male teachers in their content, pedagogical, and dispositional development.
   Originality/value - This work adds to the limited body of literature that highlights the experiences of black teachers in a subject-specific context, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subject areas that have historically marginalized the participation of black people.

AB This article examines Black male students' perceptions of the role of race and racism in perpetuating the school-to-prison pipeline. Through a phenomenological investigation of ten Black male students in the New Orleans area, this article finds that Black male students perceive racism in society, racism in schools, and poor teacher expectations to aid in the perpetuation of the school-to-prison pipeline. Furthermore, the participants of this study revealed that schools may use other Black males who have successfully navigated the educational system to better reach Black male students who are placed at risk of the school-to-prison pipeline. This article considers the responses of theses Black male students to the role of race and racism in the context of critical race theory.

AB Studies persistently show disparities in exclusionary discipline across racial/ethnic groups in U.S. schools. Using administrative data from kindergarteners through fifth graders in Indiana, we examine the effects of student-teacher race/ethnicity matching on disciplinary outcomes. We find that Black students exhibit lower rates of suspension and expulsion when they study with Black teachers-driven mainly by fewer defiance and profanity offenses. By contrast, for Latinx and White students, having a teacher of the same race/ethnicity is not associated with suspension and expulsion. In light of the shortage of Black teachers in the teacher workforce, our findings underscore the vulnerability of Black students to exclusionary discipline in the early stages of schooling.

TI Meditating Gunrunner Speaking, Part I: A Black Male Journey Teaching in
   South Korea
SO EDUCATIONAL STUDIES-AESA
LA English
DT Article
ID RACE
AB In this article, I offer my own decolonizing counterstory of teaching as a Black American man in a teacher education program in South Korea, to purport how I was both a colonizer and the colonized, inside and outside of the classroom and the curriculum (Asher, 2010; Baszile, 2008, 2009, 2010). To further complicate matters, my Black male body did not fit the Eurocentric manuscript of who teaches in South Korea, rendering me a problem (Du Bois, 1903/1969), and also placing a particular high value on Eurocentric epistemologies (Mignolo, 2011a). To decolonize my Black teaching experiences in South Korea, I rely on Baszile's (2010) critical race currere to perform a reading of my radical Black subjectivity in exile, while also tending to the public/private autobiographical racialization in an East Asian context. Thus, it leads me to raise the following questions: (1) What does it mean to teach while Black and male in South Korea? (2) How does one's Black man's story decolonize the narrative of who teaches abroad? To address these ontological/epistemological questions that Baszile addresses in her work, I begin with three vignettes (named meditations). The first meditation finds me strolling through a Korean neighborhood on my way to a coffee shop. The second meditation finds a cohort of Korean pre-service teachers and me in a coffee shop discussing Korean education and Black violence in America. The third meditation follows me home after my incident in the coffee shop. Ultimately, to decolonize ourselves as teachers and learners, I propose as many curriculum studies scholars do, that we must continue to offer counterdiscourses (Asher, 2010) to our racialization and colonization. Herein lies the importance of my meditations.

AB The association between students' academic identity and their academic outcomes has been well-established. The importance of a positive school climate has also been widely documented. However, Black males experience factors that uniquely and collectively comprise their school climate. As such, the purpose of this study was to test the extent to which school climate mediated the relationships between math academic identity and math outcomes of Black males. Bootstrapping mediation analyses were conducted in a sample of students in the 11th grade (n= 1,106) using data from the High School Longitudinal Study. Results indicated that students' math identity was positively associated with math scores. Moreover, partial mediation was established, demonstrating that school climate partially explained the relationship between math identity and student outcomes. Implications of these findings for school administrators, teachers, and counselors are discussed.

AB Despite research linking teachers' occupational health to student outcomes, the processes through which these associations exist are unknown. In a sample of 516 teachers, four latent profiles of occupational health were identified, indicated by job stress, occupational burnout, and teaching self-efficacy: lowest occupational health (17%), low-to-mid occupational health/mid self-efficacy (38%), mid-to-high occu-pational health/mid-self-efficacy (30%), and highest (15%) occupational health. Proactive behavior management practices were observed less frequently for teachers in the lowest (vs. highest) occupational health profile. White female teachers were associated with profiles of low occupational health more than White male teachers, and male and female teachers of color.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current study relies on in-depth interviews with 65 Black males to explore their experiences in a Black Male Initiative (BMI) program at three different higher education institutions in the US. In discussing their narratives, the students articulate the qualitative contributions that BMI had on their sense of self and connectedness on campus. In particular, BMI helped the men formulate a micro-community, which was centered on their shared experiences and cultural familiarity and provided opportunities for them to learn more about themselves. The research findings detail the men's bonding experiences, including ways their identities matter in how they relate to one another, connect and engage with other Black men, and learn about their race and gender identities. These findings challenge deficit projections of Black male students as underachieving and uncaring about their education (and future) and highlight some benefits they attribute to and accrue from being in community.

AB Longstanding discipline disparities for Black male students are associated with untoward outcomes and necessitate feasible and effective school-based solutions. This study examined the efficacy of GREET-STOPP-ROMPT (GSP) as a low-cost, potentially high-yield strategy designed to intervene on putative malleable root causes proximal to teacher-student interactions. GSP relies on three core components to mitigate proximal causes of exclusionary discipline decisions, including: (a) proactive classroom management strategies; (b) a self-regulation technique to mitigate the impact of teacher biases on the response to problem behavior; and (c) reactive strategies to increase empathic, consistent, and appropriate responses to problem behavior. Overall, results from a single case experimental concurrent multiple baseline design across schools indicated that the GSP strategy yielded systematic reductions in risk ratios. More specifically, these results showed that the likelihood of Black male students receiving an office referral was cut by two thirds following implementation of the GSP strategy. In addition, findings from this study indicated that Black male students' self-reported school connections significantly improved from pre-to postintervention. Implications, limitations, and future directions of the results are discussed.

TI Dirt on My Record: Rethinking Disciplinary Practices in an All-Black,
   All-Male Alternative Class
SO HARVARD EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In this empirical study, the authors draw on classroom observations and interviews with twenty-three Black male ninth graders in an urban district to focus on the nature of disciplinary practices in an all-Black, all-male manhood development class. While scholars have identified the "discipline gap" as a salient aspect of the experience of Black male students in schools, few studies offer insight into the nature of disciplinary practices in spaces that Black male students view as supportive and positive. Existing studies also rarely capture African American male student perceptions of classroom and school discipline at the high school level. Utilizing Althusser (1971) and Leonardo (2005) to theorize about the racialized nature of discipline in schools, the authors find that a reframing of discipline within this alternative setting provides a counternarrative to how Black male students are typically perceived to respond to school discipline. The authors argue that, led by a "hero teacher," the manhood development class functions as an example of "transformative resistance" (Giroux, 2001), changing how Black male students perceive themselves.

AB In this study, we utilized a case study approach to examine the perspectives of 20 school stakeholders regarding equitable ways they promote and broaden the participation of Black male students in a high school academy of engineering (AOE). Madison River Academy (pseudonym) is a comprehensive high school with an AOE embedded in it. The ethnic and racial backgrounds of students at Madison River Academy are 68.8% Black, 14.4% Latinx, 8.7% White, 4.3% Asian, and 3.4% Multiracial. Three themes emerged from our data analyses of the school stakeholder interviews, including the following: (a) a cultural mismatch: denoting the cultural disconnect between teachers and Black male students; (b) math as a gatekeeper: symbolizing mathematics as a barrier Black male participation in the AOE; and (c) promoting equitable access: representing strategies the school stakeholders discussed that could address the equity issues within the AOE. More specifically, within the promoting equitable access theme, two subthemes emerged: building vertical pathways from middle to high school and applying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pathways. We provide recommendations for addressing the equity issues within our case study and promoting higher levels of participation of Black male students in the AOE.

Themes uncovered in the data included influential mothers, recognition of giftedness, and support from significant teachers and mentors. These factors interacted to shape a belief in self and internal motivation within the gifted Black males. Additional themes in the data included the multiple talents of the gifted males nurtured through involvement in extracurricular activities and their positive experiences with an integrated peer group. The final theme in the data accentuated the participants' ability to ignore racist experiences within the university environment and remain focused on their goals. Implications of the findings designed for university educators dedicated to meeting the needs of gifted African American college students are presented.

TI Black Adolescent Boys' Perceived School Mattering: From Marginalization

AB Inspired by Black Lives Matter activism, we used racialized lenses on social-psychological "mattering" to investigate how Black high school boys' interactions shaped their perceived mattering. Researchers conducted interviews with 17 self-identified Black boys who were part of a larger school-based partnership called The Black Boy Mattering Project. Participants reported experiencing and resisting interpersonal marginal mattering (e.g., evidenced in negative interactions with educators and peers and fueled by racist stereotypes) and described mattering partially through selective love (e.g., inferring significance through athletics, yet deemed anti-intellectual). Our study exhibits how schools uphold systemic anti-Black racist notions that shape relationships between Black boys and their peers and educators and diminish adolescents' self-concepts. Implications aim to support educators and researchers in radically affirming Black boys in school contexts.

AB This study examines the schooling of black male students in a U.S. high school. Drawing upon positioning theory and student resistance literature, I describe how the students make meaning of the pathologizing positioning practices of the school, including how they resist and internalize dominant discourses about black masculinity and how their performances of particular masculinities within the school are met with surveillance, regulation, and discipline. I argue that schools are locations where dominant ideologies of black masculinities are imposed, contested, and sometimes reproduced.

AB Background/Context: Over the last three decades, considerable attention has been given to the social and educational conditions of Black males. Such observations have led to the accusation that Black males are "in crisis." Although such pronouncements call national attention to the needs of Black males, these discourses have helped to normalize and fasten in place an unchanging and reworked narrative for discussing or addressing the conditions of Black males. The intent of this article is to show how, for numerous decades, both the findings and theories used to make sense of Black males within the social science and education literature have helped to produce a common-sense narrative about all Black males.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The purpose of this article is to trouble historical and contemporary beliefs about Black males and to help prompt new theories, research, and interventions that account for the complex needs of Black males' lives. This article historically documents the social science and educational literature about Black males from the 1930s to the present. Two interrelated questions guided this analysis: (1) What are the common and recycled discourses employed within and across historical periods to make sense of the social and educational conditions of Black males? (2) To what extent and in what ways have these discourses closed off the kinds of questions one can ask in the present to address the social and educational conditions of Black males? This article concludes with a discussion of how researchers and educators can begin to ask new questions about Black males that explore the complexities of Black males' lives, while also challenging the same old stories that pervade educational discourse.
   Research Design: Historicizing of knowledge was the method used in this project. Historicizing of knowledge as a method of analysis examines how trajectories of the past help to shape how "ideas and events of the present are constructed," in the words of Thomas Popkewitz. Employing this historical approach, this study focused on the visibility and presentation of theories and explanations about Black males, both adults and youth, in social science and educational literature over subsequent decades-(a) 1930s-1950s, (b) 1960s-1970s, and (c) 1980s to the present-to assess their durability and how they were changed (i.e., nuanced), if at all, over time.
   Findings/Results: The findings from this analysis illustrate that the populational reasoning of Black males has been framed around four recursive conceptual narratives-absent and wandering, impotent and powerless, soulful and adaptive, and endangered and in crisis-from the 1930s to the present.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: What these findings illustrate is the necessity for educational theorists and practitioners to ask new questions beyond the populational reasoning that has consumed educational discourse about Black males. The first step is for researchers and practitioners to take notice of whether typical explanations or narratives of deficit and difference guide their questions about Black male achievement, and for researchers and educators to carefully examine the diversity of Black male experiences beyond the dominant tropes of pathology and difference that have persisted within educational discourse.

AB The purpose of this preregistered study was to examine whether patterns of teachers' race and gender biases found in prior research would emerge in a virtual teaching context. We asked a national sample of 989 teachers to evaluate student work pictured in screenshots of a virtual classroom showing students explaining their work. We randomly assigned the images of students depicted in the virtual classroom and tested whether the race or gender of the student would trigger biases with regard to teachers' evaluations of correctness, student ability, and recommendations that students be tested for gifted programs or special education services. We found no evidence of correctness or ability bias, but that teachers recommended male students more often to be tested for gifted programs and Black students for IEPs based on the same student work. We also conducted exploratory analyses revealing that school enrollment rates of Black students moderated teachers' ability and tracking biases.

AB Guided by ecological and integrative theories of child development, this article examined the associations between multiple systems of influence (school and family) and the educational aspirations of Black Bermudian adolescent boys. This study used qualitative data gleaned from semistructured interviews with students in their senior year at a Bermudian public high school (N = 18, M-age = 18). Findings revealed that family members and teachers encouraged boys to stay committed to school, thereby supporting high school graduation, academic confidence, and educational aspirations for higher education. However, boys had not learned enough about the complicated process of college and fellowship applications to execute their educational goals, leaving them to wonder what's next? This study contributes to our cross-cultural and nuanced understanding of the important role that families and teachers play in the educational lives of Black male adolescents and suggests that interventions targeting families and teachers might promote the educational attainment, and consequent earnings, of Black male students.

AB Background/Context: High school educational environments find Black males experience systemic racial microaggressions in the form of discipline policies, academic tracking and hege-monic curriculum. Black males in high school are more likely than their White male peers to have high school truancies and be viewed as intentionally sinister. African American males are labeled by White teachers and administrators as deviant for issues like talking in class, dress code violations and being tardy. Deficit perceptions about African American students as held by White teachers and administrators serve as racial microaggressions within K-12 context.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Racial microaggressions based on prejudicial White beliefs of teachers impedes the learning process of participants. Racial microaggressive acts are problematic due to being a symptom of the overarching campus racial climate, which is often indicative of the negative historic treatment of Black males by Whites. The cumulative impact of racial microaggressions on Black males negatively impacts self-image, academic performance, and social navigation skills. Examining how Black males responded to racial microaggressions by White teachers and administrators at culturally diverse high school settings was the impetus for this study.
   Research Design: To understand how African American male students responded to racial microaggressions qualitative research was used. Conducting a study that focuses on multiple individualistic lived experiences, I am mindful that "human actions cannot be understood unless the meaning that humans assign to them is understood." This comparative case study allowed for narrative expression, which informed the experiential meanings participants as-signed to enduring racial microaggressions by gathering in-depth information through mul-tiple sources to understand participants' real life meanings to situations.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Participants' engaged in pro-active navigation strategies to minimize and counter racial microaggressions. Navigation strategies were influenced by in-and out-of-class interactions with White teachers and student peers. Analysis of the data gathered during interviews, focus groups, and observations confirmed the racial microaggressive lived experiences of participants. Three themes emerged: (1) monolithic targeting; (2) integrative fluidity; and (3) behavioral vacillation. Participants avoided monolithic targeted racial microaggression(s) by creating meaningful alliances within other racialized student populations by utilizing social and extracurricular relationships as protective barriers to lessen the adverse effects of racial microaggressive experiences.

AB Teacher-student sexual misconduct is a serious instance of child sexual abuse that impacts an estimated 10% of students. We tested whether two effects seen in research about these types of cases replicated across online American adult and undergraduate samples: (1) sympathy toward younger students who experience sexual abuse compared to older students and (2) leniency in cases of female teachers engaging with male students compared to other gender dyads. Participants (N = 525) reviewed a mock teacher-student sexual encounter and then answered questions about their views and case-related outcomes. Student age emerged as the most influential factor across all our variables of interest, where cases with younger students were viewed as more egregious than those involving older students. Incidents involving boys who experienced abuse were perceived as more "normal" than those involving girls. We found some support for the idea that there is leniency toward women teachers, but limited support for a female teacher-male student leniency effect. While these cases were viewed to be more normal and acceptable than other gender dyads, there were no effects on the other dependent variables. Sample type effects were also minimal, as our adult sample viewed the teachers involved to be more responsible and student complainants as more credible versus the undergraduate sample.

TI Escalation effects in teacher perceptions of classroom behavior in a US

AB Prior experimental, vignette-based research has illustrated an "escalation effect," whereby classroom teachers in the United States respond more harshly to Black students than White students for the same recurring misbehavior (Okonofua & Eberhardt, 2015). This research aims to examine escalation effects while also (1) considering misbehavior varying in severity, and (2) expanding beyond the male-only, Black-White student dichotomy that dominates this area of research by adopting an intersectional approach that includes male and female target students from Black, White, Asian, and Latino/a backgrounds. Participants included 1,013 kindergarten through 12(th) grade teachers from a large public school district who responded to vignettes describing classroom misbehavior. Results supported the Black escalation effect for male and female students, with some evidence of heightened escalation for Black males. No similar effects were found for Asian or Latino/a students. The escalation effect appears to be uniquely associated with Black students, carrying important implications for teacher training and school discipline policies.

AB This paper describes how the literacy achievement of low socioeconomic status 17 Black male middle school students in one classroom was influenced by culturally responsive teaching. The study employed a concurrent transformative mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data consisted of pretest and posttest reading scores from the computer adaptive interim assessment, Measurement of Academic Progress during the 2017-2018 academic school year. Qualitative data included the teacher's journal of reflective field notes. The findings suggested that pedagogy that mirrors students' cultural values, beliefs, and lifestyles empowered students in ways that yielded improved literacy achievement for this group. This study added further support for the use of such pedagogy with Black male students as well as other potentially vulnerable populations.

AB Differential treatment of students by race is well documented, and potentially driven by implicit processes relating to racial prejudice. To better understand some of the pathways by which racial prejudice may be activated, we examined preservice teachers' racialized perceptions specific to emotion. Forty preservice teachers identified the emotions expressed in 20 Black and White male and female faces in order to assess racialized emotion accuracy and anger bias; participants also judged hostility in videos of 4 Black and White boys' misbehaviors with peers in school in order to assess racialized attributions. We conducted a series of multilevel models with assessments of Black and White faces (or boys) nested within preservice teachers. Results indicated that emotions in Black faces were less accurately recognized than emotions in White faces; Black faces were more likely to be seen as angry even when they were not, compared to White faces; and boys' misbehaviors were perceived as more hostile than those of White boys. Together, these results consistently suggest that racialized emotion-related perceptions may enter the classroom with preservice teachers. Implications, as well as limitations that may be resolved in future studies, and extensions of these findings to other minority status populations are discussed.

AB Although mentoring programs can produce positive outcomes for youth, more research is needed that offers an account of how Black and Latino male mentors and mentees experience mentoring. This phenomenological study highlights the voices of a mentor and 14 Black and Latino males who are part of the Umoja Network for Young Men (UMOJA) an all-male, in-school mentoring program at an alternative high school that serves overage, under-credited students. We extend the concept of culturally responsive caring by examining notions of reciprocal love and an ethos of care that characterize the mentor's and mentees' discussions of their mentoring experiences.

AB Our secondary analysis of Measures of Effective Teaching data contributes to growing evidence that observation ratings, used as part of comprehensive teacher evaluation systems across the nation, may measure factors outside of a teacher's performance or control. Specifically, men and teachers in classrooms with high concentrations of Black, Hispanic, male, and low-performing students receive significantly lower observation ratings. By using various methodological approaches and a subsample of teachers randomly assigned to classrooms, we demonstrate that these differences are unlikely due to actual differences in teacher quality. These results suggest that policymakers consider the unintended consequences of using observational ratings to evaluate teachers and consider ways to adjust ratings to ensure they are fair.

AB Black male college graduation gaps pose critical questions for parents, teachers, policymakers, and the Black community. Black males face systemic challenges that derail them from higher education. This research, drawing on a larger study, investigated Black parental expectations, strategies, and activities used to cultivate academic success and foster the development of college aspiration in high schoolaged sons. The findings revealed a central theme of parenting with intent, that Black parents: (1) reinforced the importance of school and learning in a family-school nexus; (2) fostered a strong value of attending and completing college to attain success; (3) held high expectations that "set the bar" for academic excellence; (4) instilled class consciousness to develop an awareness of the utility of college; (5) aided in the development of responsibility, agency, and self-efficacy; and (6) evidenced a commitment to their sons as their "first priority" by helping them navigate the college admissions process.

AB An infusion of federal funding and philanthropic support for high schools has sparked an unprecedented number of educational reforms. Still, few initiatives confront the unique conditions facing Black male students. Despite efforts to reform ineffective schools and foster academic achievement for all students, there continues to be a lingering gap between affluent and poor as well as White and Black subgroups. This article explores the complexities of these issues. The authors examine the negative effects of intractable social barriers such as poverty and ineffective schooling. They suggest that currents trends reflect responsible approaches to reform but that the potential role of Black teachers has not been fully explored.

AB This paper speaks to the lived experiences of gay male teachers working in K-12 settings of color as I as an individual researcher and as we as allies to begin to address the pervasive and loud silences of our attenuated presence in education. This study addresses the experiences of gay (one Black male and two Latinos) teachers of color and will identify and analyze characteristics, how the intersections of race and sexuality impact the principles and themes within the teaching strengths of three gay teachers of color and examine how the successful teaching of gay teachers of color can be used to inform social justice-oriented matters.

AB Teachers are an important source of information for traditionally disadvantaged students. However, little is known about how teachers form expectations and whether they are systematically biased. We investigate whether student teacher demographic mismatch affects high school teachers' expectations for students' educational attainment. Using a student fixed effects strategy that exploits expectations data from two teachers per student, we find that non-black teachers of black students have significantly lower expectations than do black teachers. These effects are larger for black male students and math teachers. Our findings add to a growing literature on the role of limited information in perpetuating educational attainment gaps.

AB We conducted lab experiments at a historically black university (HBCU), replicating the design and procedure, but not the results, of previous stereotype threat studies. The experimental design has two factors: stereotype salience (priming) and the identity of the experimenter (a less-threatening black woman vs. a more-threatening white man). Unlike previous studies, we found no effect of stereotype threat on student performance. We find little evidence that black students at the HBCU are affected by stereotype threat, regardless of the identity of the experimenter. We found no significant difference in the number of questions answered correctly by subjects in the control and treatment conditions in either the white male or the black female experimenter sessions. Finally, we found little evidence to support our prediction that subjects would respond differently to the identity of the experimenter. Having a black female experimenter, as opposed to a white male experimenter, had no effect on the number of questions answered correctly. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze the demographic profile of candidates seeking music teacher licensure in the United States and to understand whether performance on the Praxis II music teacher licensure tests varies systematically as a function of various demographic characteristics. Praxis II music test data and background questionnaire responses, provided by the Educational Testing Service, were analyzed for all examinees from 2007 through 2012 (N= 20,521). Results showed that music teacher licensure candidates were a highly selected subset of the population. Candidates identified as 86.02% White, 7.07% Black, 1.94% Hispanic, 1.79% Asian, 0.30% Native American/Alaska Native, 0.32% Pacific Islander, 0.82% Multiracial, and 1.74% Other. Compared to various populations of interest with known ethnic/racial compositions, people of color were significantly underrepresented among music teacher licensure candidates, while White people were significantly overrepresented. Analyses of Praxis II music exam scores showed that Praxis II score was significantly associated with race, sex, and other demographic characteristics. Analyses indicated that White candidates earned significantly higher Praxis II scores than did Black candidates and that male candidates earned significantly higher scores than did female candidates. Implications of these results for music teacher education and the diversity of the music teacher workforce are discussed.

AB Background: Gender may alter African Americans' vulnerability to discrimination. The type of outcomes that follow exposure to discrimination may also be gender-specific. Although teacher discrimination is known to deteriorate school performance, it is yet unknown whether male and female African American youth differ in the effect of teacher discrimination on school performance. Objective: This cross-sectional study explored the moderating role of gender on the effect of teacher discrimination on school performance in a national sample of African American youth. Methods: The National Survey of American Life-Adolescent Supplement (NSAL-A) enrolled a nationally representative sample (n = 810) of 13-17-year-old African American youth. Demographic factors, socioeconomic status, teacher discrimination, and school performance (grade point average, GPA) were measured. Linear multivariable regression models were applied for data analysis. Results: Males and females reported similar levels of perceived teacher discrimination. In the pooled sample, higher teacher discrimination was associated with lower school performance among African American youth (b = -0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.49 to -0.22). Gender interacted with perceived teacher discrimination (b = 12; 95% CI = 0.24-2.02), suggesting a significant difference between males and females in the magnitude of the association between perceived teacher discrimination and GPA. In stratified models, perceived teacher discrimination was associated with worse school performance of females (b = -12; 95% CI = -0.03 to -2.78) but not males (b = 0.01; 95% CI = -0.07 to 0.08). Conclusion: In line with previous studies, gender was found to alter the vulnerability of African American youth to perceived discrimination. African American boys and girls may differ in their sensitivity to the effects of teacher discrimination on school performance.

   OUTCOMES
AB Students of color, especially Black males identified as having emotional behavior disorders (EBD), are overrepresented in exclusionary practices. Exclusionary practices, such as in-school suspension, out-of-school suspension, and expulsion, negatively impact academic and social-emotional-behavioral outcomes for all students, especially students with EBD. This article identifies the overlapping principles of culturally responsive teaching and culturally responsive pedagogy as theorized by Gay and Ladson-Billings so that teachers of students of color identified with EBD can better support the specific learning needs of their students. These principles are explicitly applied to behavior-specific praise and error corrections, two evidence-based classroom behavioral management practices.

AB Popular discourses surrounding male teachers of color can serve to reify confining and problematic notions of masculinity in schools. Taking a critical approach to the study of gender and race, this article highlights the ways schools reproduce specifically Latino male identity through the cultural expectations of Latino male educators, as well as the gender performance of Latino male teachers themselves. Through an ethnographic case study of a middle school Latino boys' program in the San Francisco Bay Area, I explore the ways one Latino male teacher navigates cultural pressures surrounding the enactment of Latino masculinity. This study uncovers the ways the scarcity of Latino male educators creates a pressure to perform specified notions of masculinity; particularly that of the domineering, hypermasculine disciplinarian. Furthermore, this study looks at embodied resistance to dominant discourses of Latino masculinity through deviant gendered performances, locating the body as a key site of struggle.

TI Exposure In and Out of School: A Black Bermudian Male's Successful
   Educational Journey
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY; LEADERSHIP; YOUTH; PEOPLES; FAMILY; LIFE
AB Background/Context: The influence of non-school based venues has been historically significant for people of African descent who have often had to buttress their schoolhouse experiences with support from community-based influences. For example, Black churches, barbershops and athletic environments like basketball courts, and soccer and cricket clubs are particularly relevant for Black males in spaces like Bermuda and urban communities in the United States.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Drawing on a larger oral history project, this paper reports the findings of a secondary narrative analysis of a Black Bermudian male to provide an in-depth understanding of his in-school and out-of-school educational experiences, identity construction and success. The authors seek to answer the following research question: How does a Black Bermudian male describe the impact of his ethnic community for shaping his successful educational journey?
   Research Design: While the larger oral history study includes data collected from 12 Black Bermudian males, the scope of this article specifically focuses on the secondary narrative analysis of the experiences of one of the participants, Brandon Smith. As a published author, high-ranking civil servant, and prominent community leader, Brandon is arguably one of the most successful Black Bermudian males of his generation.
   Findings/Results: The results of the study reveal that the participant's educational success was undergirded by his exposure to varying constructs related to his personal and cultural identity; exposure to engaged educators, mentors, spaces, and opportunities in elementary, secondary, and post-secondary settings; and exposure to mechanisms of identity and success in the geographical spaces of Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the United States.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Three subsections of the participant's exposure are discussed in the manuscript: nondeficit community and school-based exposure, multigenerational academically legitimizing support, and border crossing exposure. This study suggests that a Black Bermudian male can experience educational success when his educational journey inside and outside of school provides balance between his knowledge and acceptance of his identity. The authors contend that the schoolhouse is not the only space or variable that defines or prepares Black males for academic (or personal) success. Furthermore, many students who identify as African American in school may also have familial connections to the Caribbean, Africa, South America, Europe, Bermuda, and other jurisdictions. As such, educators should consider the significance of regional differences on Black male identities (e.g., North, South, East, West, Midwestern), and find ways to help students see relevance between their personal identities and larger causes and contexts.

AB No counseling research exists about how otherfathering affects Black men's wellness. Black otherfathering has been primarily studied in schools as one of many expectations for Black male teachers. A review of research about the relationship between fathering, otherfathering, and mental health in Black men is presented and concludes with a rationale for more research about Black otherfathering as a potential protective factor for Black men's mental health.

We used the CRT tenets of racism as normal and permanent and intersectionality and antiessentialism to help us make sense of the findings. Findings revealed that race and racism did not negatively impact the case study participant's experiences within his school psychology program at the university. However, racism was pervasive during his internship year, as it influenced interactions with white teachers and parents. Implications for school psychology graduate education are discussed, including the need for school psychologists to actively engage behaviors that disrupt systems of oppression like racism if the profession is to meet its antiracist aims. Impact Statement This case study uses Critical Race Theory to help us make sense of a Black male's experiences in a school psychology program. Findings showed the participant did not perceive his race or racism as a barrier to relationships with program peers or faculty, but racism negatively impacted his experience at his field-based internship sites. Implications suggest the need for school psychology graduate programs to enroll students who are inclusive and open to engaging racial issues, faculty who engage culturally-responsive mentoring practices, and the presence of school psychologists of color as university professors and supervisors in PK-12 schools.

TI Researching the Neighborhood and Schooling Experiences of Black Male
   High School "Students Who Play Sports" in Atlanta and Chicago

   COMMUNITY; WHITE; SURVEILLANCE
AB Background/Context: The corpus of scholarship on Black male students who play sports focuses on students at the collegiate level, thus ignoring the regional, neighborhood, and K-12 educational backgrounds and experiences of these young people before some matriculate into a college or university. This omission suggests the need for more robust investigations that (a) focus on Black males during K-12 schooling, (b) place Black male students' experiences within the larger geographic (e.g., regions, neighborhoods and schools) and social and historical contexts in which they live and go to school, and thereby, (c) seek to understand how these contexts shape students' experiences and beliefs about race and the role of academics and athletics in their lives and future.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: We investigated two research questions: (1) For Black male students who play high school sports, how do the social contexts shape their experiences and their beliefs about race and the role of academics and athletics in their lives and future? (2) And, what are the consequences of Black male students' experiences and beliefs for their academic and athletic outcomes? This investigation across geographically and economically contrasting cities, neighborhoods, and schools in the U.S. South (metro Atlanta, Georgia) and Midwest (Chicago, Illinois) offers empirical, theoretical, and practice-related evidence about young Black males' experiences and beliefs about race, academics, and athletics, while providing a window into the complex social and cultural worlds in which they live, go to school, and play sports.
   Research Design: This article emanates from research studies that employed ethnographic research methods such as interviews and observations, while embedding the researchers within the communities where Black people resided. The research design used a cross-case analysis to investigate participants' experiences and beliefs. The constant comparative method allowed for the synthesizing of data collected from two different research sites.
   Description of Main Findings: Key findings revealed the importance for researchers to consider place and its implication in the experiences of Black male students who play sports, particularly their perceptions of the role of academics, athletics, and race in their lives.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This article moves the scholarly understanding of the study of Black male "students who play sports" forward by illuminating the centrality of places, whether a particular country, region, city, neighborhood, or school-in shaping participants' experiences and beliefs. We offer insights for research, theory, and practice.

AB Teacher-reported measures of treatment integrity (the extent to which prescribed practices are delivered as intended by teachers) have the potential to support efforts to evaluate and implement evidence-based interventions in early childhood settings. However, self-report treatment integrity measures have shown poor correspondence with observer-report treatment integrity measures, raising questions about score validity. This paper reports on the development and initial evaluation of the score reliability and validity of the Treatment Integrity Measure for Early Childhood Settings Teacher Report (TIMECS-TR), which is designed to address limitations of previous self-report treatment integrity measures that may have contributed to low correspondence with observer-rated measures. The TIMECS-TR includes 24 items designed to represent practices found in evidence-based interventions delivered in early childhood settings that target child social, emotional, and behavioral skills, rather than adherence to practices found in a specific evidence-based intervention. Fifty-four teachers (92.6% female, 7.4% male; 61.1% White) completed the TIMECS-TR weekly for a total of 618 times (M = 6.79 per child; SD = 2.16; range 2 to 11) about the practices they delivered with 91 children (45.1% female, 54.9% male; M = 4.53 years old; SD = 45.1% Black) who were at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders. Analyses indicated that the TIMECS-TR items evidenced mild to moderate test-retest score reliability over one week. However, analyses did not support the convergent score validity of the TIMECS-TR items or scale with observational ratings of the same practices. Teachers reported higher levels of practice delivery on the TIMECS-TR items relative to observer report. Overall, our findings raise concerns about the accuracy of teacher-report adherence measures. Lessons from this research can be used to identify possible reasons for the low correspondence between teacher- and observer-report treatment integrity measures so that future research can strive to dependably capture teacher delivery of the practices found in evidence-based interventions.

TI Renaming the Narrative, Reclaiming Their Humanity: Black and Latino
   Males' Descriptions of Success
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID ACHIEVEMENT; EDUCATION; SCHOOLS; AM
AB Background/Context: An ongoing challenge for scholars who examine the educational experiences of young men of color, particularly Black and Latino males, is to illustrate the complex nature of their experiences and to call into question the dichotomous narrative that these students are either successful or unsuccessful. There is a responsibility for scholars to present a balanced, more nuanced analysis and to highlight that, while a significant number of these young men are underperforming compared to their peers from other backgrounds, there are many students who are doing quite well in school. While interrogati ng the notion of success can be a complex task, one of the concerns in the professional literature has been that the definition is frequently limited to narrow or conventional standards (i.e., high GPA, high test scores, etc.). While these examples of success are indeed important, we maintain that they do not capture the full spectrum of favorable educational and social outcomes of Black and Latino male students both inside and outside of schools.
   Purpose/Objective: This study operates from the standpoint that many Black and Latino males are thriving, yet their stories are rarely told, especially by the young men themselves. The objective of the study is to challenge conventional depictions of Black and Latino males by better understanding how these young men perceive themselves, as well as how they conceptualize success. Thus, the questions that anchored this study include: How do Black and Latino males describe themselves? In what ways do they operationalize the term "success"? And what can researchers, practitioners, and policymakers learn from student perceptions of success?
   Research Design: The study included in-depth qualitative interviews that were conducted in person. The interviews were audio recorded and subsequently transcribed. Transcripts were uploaded to a qualitative data analysis program. Prevalent themes, topics, key terms, and phrases were all identified and ultimately represented recurring patterns and codes within the data.
   Findings/Results: Students defined success in similar ways to how they described themselves. "Hardworkin" "determined," and "able to work with others" were a few descriptors offered by the participants. Moreover, the young men expressed an inherent belief that success was not relegated to school alone and that it was equally important to make their mark in their respective homes and communities. Establishing financial security, emphasizing self-improvement, helping their families and communities, and just wanting to be happy were other ways in which the participants defined success.
   Conclusion: Allowing students to develop their own definitions of success can serve as an impetus toward a shift away from thinking that success is in how others define the term. Success for these young men was the ability to write their own narrative.

DT Article
ID EDUCATION
AB The black southern press was an entity dominated by male editors and entrepreneurs. The effort to equalize teacher pay, one of the core fights for rights in the South, and the principal effort at gendered race advocacy during the World War II era, was led in large measure by black women. While both the fight for salary equalization and the survival of the black press depended upon segregation to maintain their survival, those newspapers were entities dominated by men advocating for equal salaries in a profession dominated by women, and the gendered nature of their coverage shaped knowledge of the fight within the black community.

DE Blacks; aged; elderly; falls; gait; near-falls; walking
ID RISK; WOMEN; OLDER
AB Background: Near-falls are a frequent, but not commonly studied, occurrence in the elderly Black population and may be related to prospective falls.
   Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship of near-falls to demographic characteristics, use of assistive devices, gait, and physical activity levels in elderly Blacks.
   Methods: Community-dwelling, elderly Black patients aging 65 and older and attending two clinics of the Mount Sinai Hospital in Harlem in New York City were recruited. The number of near-falls during the past year was self-reported using the Elderly Falls Screening Test. The Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity was used to assess aerobic and anaerobic activity levels. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors of near-falls.
   Results: A total of 120 elderly Black adults took part in the study. Prevalence of occasional or frequent near-falls was 52.5%. In the final trimmed model, time of the 5-m observed walk (OR = 1.41, p =.001) and being male (OR = 3.68, p =.02) were significant predictors of near-fall experiences.
   Discussion: Future research needs to be done in elderly Black populations to determine what factors may contribute to men experiencing more near-falls and on the relation between near-falls and falls.

TI From Jay-Z to Dead Prez: Examining Representations of Black Masculinity
   in Mainstream Versus Underground Hip-Hop Music
SO JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Black masculinity; hip-hop; patriarchy; manhood
AB The evolution of hip-hop music and culture has impacted the visibility of Black men and the Black male body. As hip-hop continues to become commercially viable, performances of Black masculinities can be easily found on magazine covers, television shows, and popular websites. How do these representations affect the collective consciousness of Black men, while helping to construct a particular brand of masculinity that plays into the White imagination? This theoretical article explores how representations of Black masculinity vary in underground versus mainstream hip-hop, stemming directly from White patriarchal ideals of manhood. Conceptual and theoretical analyses of songs from the likes of Jay-Z and Dead Prez and Imani Perry's Prophets of the Hood help provide an understanding of the parallels between hip-hop performances/identities and Black masculinities.

TI The roles of Black women principals: evidence from two national surveys

AB While two-thirds of Black principals are female, the extant research on Black female principals is almost entirely qualitative. Using data from the 2017-2018 National Teacher and Principal Survey (n = 7,170 with 450 Black female principals) and the 2011-2012 Schools and Staffing Survey (n = 7,510, with 360 Black female principals), we quantitatively examine the career paths, reported influence, and reported time use of Black female principals compared to other principals. Black female principals are relatively less likely than Black male principals to have experience as athletic coaches, and less likely to have non-education management experience. Relative to non-Black female principals, Black female principals are less likely to have experience as curriculum directors. Relative to other principals, Black female principals generally report having comparable influence over their schools, while spending somewhat more time on parent interactions, suggestive of roles representing minority parents. We discuss implications and directions for future research.

AB Existing research examines whether studying with teachers of the same race/ethnicity affects student achievement, but little is known about whether those effects vary by timing and frequency. We use 7 years of administrative data from third through eighth graders in Indiana to estimate the heterogenous links between same race/ethnicity teachers and achievement by school level (i.e., elementary vs. middle schools) and self-contained classroom (i.e., self-contained vs. departmentalized classrooms). We find that the positive links between same race/ethnicity teachers and improved achievement are stronger for elementary school students and students in self-contained classrooms, particularly for Black students. Our findings highlight the importance of timing and frequent exposure to same race/ethnicity teachers in academic trajectories.

AB In this article, I propose a critical, alternative framing of Black boys, asserting that Black boys are vulnerable resources rather than problems. Black boys are susceptible to racist and ableist practices and discourses, and they deserve special protection and services in school that do not position them as "in need of repair." Despite the multiple oppressions they face, Black boys are assets to themselves and their communities. I contrast this alternative framing against an existing framing of schooling for Black boys: the dominant, functionalist approach that advances a deficiency narrative. I situate this discussion within the context of urban education.

AB In recent years, there has been an increase in mental health struggles among Black girls, with concurrent increases in interpersonal violence in this group. However, there has been limited research into the structural, environmental, and psychosocial risk factors associated with these increases. A lack of understanding of these dynamics has left a gap in the implementation of targeted mental health and violence prevention/mitigation strategies for this sociomedically vulnerable population. Using semistructured interviews with staff at five high schools in the metropolitan Chicago area (n = 32), including teachers (n = 14), administrators (n = 9), and security officials (n = 9), we assessed perspectives on the mental health profiles and violence involvement of Black teen girls using abductive analysis and constant comparative methods. Respondents consistently indicated that violence was either more frequent among Black girls or felt more intractable, relative to (Black) males or other non-Black female students. Primary risk factors discussed included Black girls' recurrent exposure to neighborhood deprivation and limited psychosocial and institutional support. Black girls who perpetrate or are victims of violence face complex identity formation challenges that are amplified by mental health challenges resulting from broader racial and gendered structures. School and community-based interventions must consider the intersectional complexities that entrench mental illness and violence in this population as a clustered co-occurring phenomenon, focusing on structural and in-school supports and adult stakeholder trainings around implicit bias and cultural humility.

AB Ethnic-racial identity formation has significant consequences for positive youth development. Existing findings support the efficacy of the Identity Project, a school-based ethnic-racial identity intervention, when delivered by researchers; however, effectiveness of the program when delivered by teachers is unknown. This study examined changes in adolescents' (N = 180; 42.2% male, 50.6% female, 6.7% another gender identity; M-age = 14.11, SD = 0.33; 38.3% Latinx, 33.9% White, 15.0% Black, 9.4% Asian American, 3.3% another ethnoracial background) ethnic-racial identity exploration as a function of their teachers' implementation of the Identity Project. Findings indicated that ethnic-racial identity exploration significantly increased from pretest to posttest, and this did not vary based on familial ethnic-racial socialization, student-teacher ethnoracial match/mismatch, gender, immigrant status, or ethnoracial background. This study provides preliminary evidence that U.S. educators can be trained to efficaciously implement the Identity Project with high school students and, furthermore, that this approach to program dissemination may not only facilitate scale-up but also result in greater gains for adolescents relative to research-led implementations.

AB As scholars account for the disproportional harm adolescent Black and Latino boys face in school, needed are studies that report on more than educator bias. Utilizing interviews and ethnographic observations from an urban charter school, I introduce and deploy the Intersectional School Power Model to illustrate how multiple school processes coalesced to uphold the criminalization of Black boys and stigmatization of Latino boys subtly and acutely. Findings show their (mis)treatment resulted from intersecting power arrangements across four school domains: the structural (e.g., organizational components), cultural (e.g., school norms), disciplinary (e.g., student corrective policies and practices), and interpersonal (e.g., daily interactions).

AB Private high schools are often viewed as bastions of scholastic and social opportunities, but the cost of tuition has rendered these sites predominantly white and more segregated than public schools. However, with the ability to recruit, Black boys have become prime targets of predominantly white private Catholic high schools seeking promising student-athletes. As a result, the population of Black boys at these schools are composed almost entirely of students recruited to play a sport. Drawing from qualitative interview data, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the racialized experiences of six Black boys who attended a predominantly white Catholic high school in which the entire Black population was composed of student-athletes. Findings indicate that participants initially saw the private Catholic school as an escape from their respective public schools but realized that mere attendance did not result in total inclusion. All six participants encountered forms of antiblackness via frequent structural and cultural assaults that made their daily attendance at the school difficult.

AB Both K-12 schools and STEM disciplines are embedded in White supremacy and exclusion, making it that much harder for Black women to maintain an interest and sense of belonging in STEM. Through a Critical Race Feminism methodology, we tell the counterstories of our two co-authors, two Black women, over the course of their lives. Through these counterstories (stories that run counter to normative stories of STEM as male and White), Kelli and Samantha show us how they negotiated and maintained a sense of belonging in STEM even through moments of self-doubt in their STEM trajectory. These negotiations allowed them to carve a space for themselves within STEM. A key finding from these counterstories was the resilience both women developed through their participation in counterspaces and support from family and teachers that helped them develop pride in their STEM identity trajectories. Our study adds to the research on Black women's journeys in STEM by describing resilience strategies that our authors were forced to develop in response to White supremacy and how they were able to maintain their STEM identity by creating a counterstory that allowed them to maintain their sense of belonging within STEM. And yet, we conclude by asking if resilience is enough since both women questioned their authentic and valued place in their respective STEM disciplines because of the dominant storyline of STEM as White and male. Their stories reveal the deeper truth that change is needed in STEM to empower students of color to see themselves as not just tolerated but valued members of the discipline.

TI The Black Podcaster-Scholar: A Critical Reflection of Using Podcasting
   as Methodology as a Black Doctoral Student
SO SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE podcasting; Black podcasters; academic writing; graduate student; public
   scholarship
AB I am a Black woman, a doctoral candidate, and a podcaster. In every facet of those identities, I have been worried about my voice. As a young child, teachers pushed me to sound "collegiate" and not "ghetto" so I could impress our private Christian school's predominantly White and male board of directors. My graduate and doctoral programs led me to challenge and critique previous ideologies around voice and audience, while also perpetuating gatekeeping via academic jargon. Podcasting became a way for me to resist falling into the social norms of voice in the academy, but not without confronting challenges the industry itself carried around voice as well as my own insecurities. Beyond a text replacement and a way for doctoral students and faculty to widen their audience and build a brand, podcasting in the academy should be recognized as a critical reflective praxis for scholars that centers the voices of those that often go silenced or ignored. This article is a critical reflection of my methodological use of podcasting to resist data collection norms and traditional research boundaries in the academy while also confronting my own internalized anti-Blackness surrounding Black sonic existence.

AB Parent and teacher ratings of the two attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom dimensions (i.e., inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity) have been found to differ across child gender, age, race, and ethnicity. Group differences could be due to actual variation in symptomatic behaviors but also could be due to measurement items functioning differently based on child characteristics. This study extended prior investigations establishing measurement invariance at the symptom dimension and item levels, by examining possible measurement variance across child demographic characteristics at the item level (i.e., differential item functioning [DIF]) in two large national samples. Using the Rasch rating scale model (Andrich Psychometrika, 43, 561-73, 1978), we examined DIF of the 18 ADHD symptoms in samples of 2079 children (n = 1037 males) from 5 to 17 years old (M = 10.7; SD = 3.8) rated by parents and 1070 children (n = 535 males) aged from 5 to 17 years old (M = 11.5; SD = 3.5) rated by teachers. All but six ADHD symptom items showed DIF across child age, gender, race (Black vs. White), and ethnicity with more items showing DIF for age than for gender, race, or ethnicity. For child gender and age, more items showed DIF for parent than for teacher ratings. More items showed DIF across racial groups for teacher than for parent ratings. Only two parent- and teacher-rated items showed DIF for ethnicity. Implications of findings for practice, research, and future iterations of ADHD diagnostic criteria are discussed.

TI Schooling Teachers, Schooling Ourselves: Insights and Reflections from
   Teaching K-12 Teachers How to Use Hip-hop to Educate Students
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Hip-hop-based education (HHBE) research analyzes how hip-hop culture is used to produce favorable educational outcomes. Despite its richness, the work reveals little about how to prepare practicing K-12 teachers to use HHBE toward the critical ends reflected in extant HHBE literature. In this article, we challenge many tacit assumptions of HHBE research by examining the curricular and pedagogical wants and needs of in-service teachers who are interested in HHBE but who are not familiar with hip-hop's unique history and culture. Through a collaborative self-study with a teacher-educator, we, as Black male hip-hop insiders, reflect on the promises and pitfalls of preparing predominantly White teachers to incorporate hip-hop into their teaching and learning repertoire.

AB Whitewashedness has been trickling down in language classrooms through assimilation and colorblind practices. These practices have irreversible effects on the psyche of immigrant and refugee learners in K-12 schools. This research study investigates 15 teacher candidates' ideologies regarding colorblindness by empowering them to create intertextual links to Ferguson event, which happened in close proximity to where they teach. The study revealed how colorblindness perpetuated among the teacher candidates when they were in schools as students, how they were empowered to unpack the meaning of colorblindness, and how the White males in the program resisted to acknowledge White privileges and colorblindness.

AB Racial disproportionality in school discipline is a major U.S. educational problem. Official data show that Black boys are disciplined at the highest rates of any racial and gender subgroup. Scholars suggest the "criminal" Black male image shapes teachers' views and treatment of their Black male students. Yet few studies examine the everyday mechanisms of racial discipline disparities, particularly in early childhood. This study uses ethnography to understand first-grade teachers' disciplinary interactions with Black and White boys. The findings uncover teachers' racialized disciplinary practices via differential surveillance of, differential engagement with, and differential responses to noncompliance from Black and White boys as key mechanisms that reproduce unequal disciplinary experiences in early childhood education.

AB This study explores adolescents' evaluations of unfair teacher and peer behavior in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes. Participants included ninth and tenth grade students from five public schools in the Southeastern United States, (N = 577, 45.9% female, 49% male, 5% other/prefer not to say/unsure). Students were ethnically representative of their communities: 48% White/European American, 22.7% Black/African American, 14% Latino/a/e/x, and 15.3% multi-racial/other/prefer not to say. Measures assessed adolescents' responses to hypothetical scenarios of unfair treatment. The findings indicate that adolescents recognize both teacher and peer unfair behavior as wrong, with nuanced differences based on participants' gender and grade. Attribution analysis reveals varied expected reasons for unfair treatment. Responses to unfair behavior differ, with adolescents more likely to confront peers than teachers. Demographic factors, school climate, discrimination, belonging, and critical consciousness contribute to variations in judgments and responses. The study highlights the importance of addressing unfair treatment in STEM settings to foster inclusivity and support student persistence in STEM.

AB Background: Pedagogical models have become an established component of physical education over the past several decades. One such model, the Teaching Personal and Social Responsibility model, has gained momentum in practice and research, though little is known regarding its use in preservice teacher training. The model follows a flexible format focused on teaching life skills (e.g. leadership) that can be applied in all lived ecologies. Occupational socialization theory provides insight into the pretraining and teacher education experiences of preservice teachers that shape their understanding and practice of physical education and associated pedagogical models. Aims: The purpose of this study was to understand the influence of a sequence of methods courses and early field experiences on U.S. preservice teachers' understanding and implementation of the teaching personal and social responsibility model with youth from a community affected by poverty. Method: This study took on a phenomenological and social constructivist approach. Ten preservice teachers (9 males, 1 female) took part in the study. The participants were an average age of 22.10 years old (SD = 4.38) and seven identified as White and three as Black. Each participant was enrolled in methods and early field experience coursework that provided scaffolded training in primary education in a community affected by poverty. Preservice teachers team-taught groups of 10-15 children twice a week along with one day committed to on-campus reflection. Data collection included autobiographical essays, critical incident reports, reflective journals, non-participatory observations and field notes, and semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed deductively through the lens of occupational socialization theory, and inductively as theory divergent trends were sought. Open and axial coding was completed with member checking throughout, resulting in a final set of themes and subthemes. Findings: The preservice teachers initially struggled to connect with their students due to conflicting backgrounds, but the teaching personal and social responsibility model guided the relationship-building process. As the model was continuously utilized, more empathy and care were shown towards the children. Preservice teachers felt there was a lack of progression in positive behaviors but were able to empower youth and felt that the model was culturally relevant. Overtime, the students began to appreciate the affective domain despite the challenge of working in a community affected by poverty through frustration towards the larger system limiting any potential progress was present. Conclusions: Subjective theories transitioned to include relationship building and life skills learning, likely because of the extended field experience and faculty support. The preservice teachers desire to connect with and teach the students well displays the connection between models-based practice and positive relationships. Preservice teachers' knowledge of their students was limited as it was based on secondhand knowledge of youth, teacher educators, and school staff. Evidence indicates some cultural responsiveness development though there were also elements of a deficit model due to white privilege and class differences. Further work explicitly integrating a culturally relevant approach and social justice in teacher education programming should occur.

TI Elevating mathematics achievement outcomes for Black boys: Guidance for
   practitioners, policymakers, and researchers
SO THEORY INTO PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS; PEDAGOGY; TEACHERS
AB School-aged Black boys are mathematically gifted; however, they are often underserved vis-a-vis their mathematics education. In this article, we provide guidance for multiple stakeholders to support and elevate high-quality mathematics learning opportunities for Black male youth. In doing so, we begin by engaging W. E. B. Du Bois' storytelling. We then offer BlackCrit as a theoretical frame to enrich evidence-based work regarding Black mathematics teachers and culturally relevant pedagogy. We also advocate for the establishment of "grow-your-own" programs given the strong links to Black male achievement as well as the critical need for continuous federal funding in service to Black boys' mathematics education. We conclude with a summary of the guidance provided to bolster school-aged Black boys' mathematics achievement outcomes.

AB Objectives: This article explores the complex relationships between race and occupational stressors among an ethnically diverse sample of high school teachers and their implications for women's mental health. Method: Interviews with Black, White, and Mexican American teachers suggest that workplaces are organized by subtle forms of gender and racial discrimination as well as White racial privilege; this context shapes women's experiences of occupational stressors. Results: The data indicate that teachers experience racially specific stressors at work and make racially specific appraisals about common stressors among all teachers. Black and Mexican American women report chronic strains, such as differential workloads, perceptions of incompetence, and lack of support from administrators, whereas White teachers report, yet minimize, sexual harassment from male colleagues. Student misbehavior, a stressor shared by all teachers, is experienced and understood as a personal failing by White teachers and as a manifestation of systemic racism by teachers of color. Conclusions: The interviews offer important insights into the ways professional workplaces remain an arena marked by racial inequality and White privilege and that racialized stressors are differentially distributed among women. Findings support claims from intersectionality in that race, racism, and racial privilege operate in multiplicative ways that create different constellations of occupational stressors among women, which in turn have implications for wellbeing.

AB This article conceptualizes "possibilities" as a challenge to the ways that Black boys are constructed and arrested through their engagement in educational spaces. Critical race scholars have deployed counter-stories to disrupt deficit framing of Black boys by discussing their possibilities, promise, and potential. Similarly, we weave these insights and analyses of Black boys' lives to identify how multiple possibilities contribute to Black boys' thriving in education. The seven dimensions of the Possibilities Framework include dreaming (related to aspirations and fantasy), caring (e.g., cared for and cared about), belonging (related to mattering and feeling connected), enjoying (related to joy), agency (their actions and autonomy), protecting (feeling safe), and affirming (related to being valued). Each of these dimensions can inform pedagogy and praxis and empower Black boys and young men in educational settings.

AB Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The primary purpose of this study is to examine the research and literature on African American male enrollment, experiences, and degree completion trends at four-year HBCUs. The secondary goal is to recenter the gendered dialogue that occurs within HBCU undergraduate student research, such that barriers specific to African American men are identified and examined, with the expectation of better promoting their postsecondary success.
   Research Design: Analytic essay, cross-sectional data analysis.
   Data Collection and Analysis: First, we conducted a review of historical and contemporary literature to identify the role and contribution of four-year HBCUs on African American males over time. In addition, we employed a secondary data analysis of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to identify six-year graduation rates for one cohort of African American male and female student at HBCUs.
   Findings/Results: Critical analysis of historical data from the mid-19th to early 21st century indicates that African American males have indeed been neglected in research on undergraduate enrollment, experiences, and degree completion at four-year HBCUs. African American males face a number of issues that are not absolved on matriculation to HBCUs merely because their environments are predominantly Black. Our analysis suggests that in general, the nurturing and supportive environment on HBCU campuses, when harnessed by African American male (and female) students, can promote postsecondary matriculation and success.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: HBCUs have undoubtedly afforded African American males a route by which to gain access to postsecondary education. However, the lack of attention toward their struggles has served to silence their gendered experience and perpetuate a lack of accountability for African American male underachievement within the higher education establishment. Future gendered analyses of HBCU undergraduates ought to address both the male and female experience on these campuses using a variety of appropriate methodological approaches.

AB This article calls attention to the social and educational challenges facing boys and men around the world. Next, it highlights how the outcomes for males of African descent across the Americas, in particular the USA, are especially troubling. Moreover, a critique is presented about the recruitment campaigns that see increasing the number of Black male teachers as an elixir for improving the crisis facing Black boys. Then, the article focuses on the intersection of race and gender and reframes the discussion around improving the deleterious school outcomes facing Black boys by shifting the conversation to exploring how educators' socialised views around gender influence the ways in which they teach boys. Finally, the article provides practical applications for designing a curriculum that is gender relevant.

AB Teachers contribute to the process of identifying and referring students for mental health services, however, relatively little is known about how they make those decisions and how decision-making differs across school contexts. This study used a vignette-based method to investigate individual and school contextual factors associated with the likelihood that teachers identify and refer students for mental health services. Teachers were recruited from public middle and high schools across the U.S. using a stratified random sampling strategy. Teachers (N = 462) responded to vignettes by indicating their concern for students, as well as their likelihood of providing mental health referrals. Vignettes varied by problem type (depression, oppositional defiant disorder), problem severity (moderate, severe), and student gender (male, female). Data on school characteristics were extracted from the U.S. Department of Education database. Regression models indicated several significant associations of teacher demographic characteristics and school characteristics with vignette ratings. For example, female teachers were more likely than males to rate vignettes as concerning, and middle school teachers were more likely than high school teachers to indicate they would refer students for mental health services. Teachers in schools with a higher proportion of Black students rated depression vignettes as less serious and indicated they were less likely to refer students for mental health services than teachers in majority white schools. Results suggest school characteristics may contribute to established disparities in mental health service access. Findings have implications for targeting mental health supports in schools.

AB The persistent racial and ethnic disparities in special education in the United States raise concerns about the potential misidentification of students. While previous studies have focused on how various student and school factors influence teacher decisions, there is less attention on when teachers disagree about student disability or special education. The current study uses national data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 to examine when teachers disagreed in their perception of student disability for more than 10,000 high school students. A unique feature of the data is each student is observed in two different subject classrooms, providing an opportunity to examine how differences in student achievement, behavior, and teacher characteristics influence when teachers disagreed in their judgment of student disability. The results indicate that teachers were more likely to disagree when student behavior varied across classrooms, while differences in student achievement and teacher characteristics were not related to disagreement. The study also found that teachers disagreed more for students who were Black, male, and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The main findings highlight how disability is often a context-dependent social construct and have implications for how students are identified for special education.

AB Drawing upon the authors' experiences working in schools as teachers, teacher educators, researchers, and community members, this study utilizes a Critical Race Theory of education in examining the school-to-prison pipeline for black male students. In doing so, the authors highlight the particular role educators play in the school-to-prison pipeline, focusing particularly on how dispositions toward black males influence educator practices. Recommendations and future directions are provided on how education preparation programs can play a critical role in the transformation of black male schooling.

AB Research focusing on disparities in academic achievement among Black, African American, and other youth has largely examined differences in quantitative risk and protective factors associated with levels of achievement. Few interpretive studies of academic achievement by race or ethnicity have considered how the context of young people's lives impact their perceptions of academic performance. Furthermore, the lived experiences of Black and African American youth have rarely been considered. This study examined perceptions of academic achievement among a sample of Black and African American elementary and middle school students living in four public housing neighborhoods in a Western US city. Twenty-five Black and African American youth participated in the study. Fourteen youth were in grades 4 and 5, and 11 youth were in grades 6, 7, or 8. Sixty-four percent of participants (n=16) were male and 36% (n=9) were female. Four themes emerged regarding participants' perceptions of academic achievement: (1) (in)equity and the internalization of messages; (2) teachers as gatekeepers; (3) family and community factors promoting and inhibiting academic success; and (4) cultural considerationslanguage, stereotypes, and difference. Implications for improving academic outcomes and reducing the achievement gap among Black, African American, and other students are noted.

AB Facilitated by the increased availability of affordable broadband Internet, individuals around the world are taking language lessons online from private tutors. A large proportion of online language tutoring takes place through online teaching platforms (OTPs), which are two-sided online markets that connect individual learners and tutors for piece-meal lessons. This paper considers how salient aspects of teachers' identities drives teacher selection on OTPs. Using a discrete choice experiment design (N = 971) distributed to online English learners from four countries, (Brazil, Italy, Spain and Korea) the paper tests hypotheses related to linguistic, racial and gender-based discrimination. The results reveal that participants' preference for L1 teachers far exceeds their preference for pedagogically qualified instructors and that learners prefer female to male teachers. Further, learners' preference for L1 teachers is stronger when the teacher is White than when the teacher is Black. The results also indicate that foreign media consumption correlates with reduced racial bias. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB The overwhelming majority of published scholarship on urban high schools in the United States focuses on problems of inadequacy, instability, underperformance, and violence. Similarly, across all schooling contexts, most of what has been written about young men of color continually reinforces deficit narratives about their educational possibility. Taken together, images of Black and Latino male students in inner-city schools often manufacture dark, hopeless visualizations of imperiled youth and educational environments. Using photographic data from a study of 325 college-bound juniors and seniors attending 40 public New York City high schools, this article counterbalances one-sided mischaracterizations of young men of color and the urban schools that educate them. Specifically, visual sociology and critical race methodologies are used to construct anti-deficit counternarratives about boys of color and urban education.

ID STUDENT SUCCESS
AB Objective: This study examines masculinity in a manner commensurate with established feminist frameworks to deconstruct a patriarchal system that ill-serves both men and women. Method: We utilized standpoint theory and narrative analysis to examine longitudinal, qualitative data from first-year Black and Latino males as they transition into community college through their second semester. Findings: Positionality is critical to understanding the success of Black and Latino males and their response to institutional structures. In many instances, men leveraged normative constructions of masculinity as aids to their success, and their resilience and confidence were filtered through their perceived development into adults. Conclusion: Implications for practice include the creation of spaces for men to talk about what it means to be a man in college and ways to influence men to make the most of resources when proffered, even if they tend to avoid seeking them out on their own. Further research should seek to understand how men develop and evolve their concepts of masculinity as well as how and to what extent spaces for men actually work to dismantle hegemonic masculinity.

TI African American males in urban schools: No excuses - Teach and empower
SO THEORY INTO PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID CRITICAL RACE THEORY; STUDENTS
AB The author outlines five promising principles, emerging from his research, on teaching that can empower teachers and Black male students in urban school contexts. In particular, teachers and students (a) envision life beyond their present situations, (b) come to know themselves in relation to others, (c) speak possibility and not destruction, (d) care and demonstrate that care, and (e) change their thinking to change their actions. The author argues that those in education should stop making excuses for why schools are failing Black male students, especially in urban schools, and do what is necessary to meet these students' needs. The central theme of the article is one of next level education, a new and more promising level of education for Black students achievable when effort and commitment are present.

AB This study investigated the moderating role of family factors on victimization experiences and internalizing and academic outcomes. Data (collected 2017-2019) on 471 Black urban ninth graders (51% male; Mage = 14 years) with elevated externalizing symptoms were analyzed and we explored how the interaction between (self-reported) racial socialization, parent relations, and (teacher-reported) family academic involvement and (self-reported) violence exposure, racial discrimination, and (teacher-reported) bullying potentially influenced (student- and teacher-reported) anxiety and depression, and (student-reported) academic engagement and negative school attitudes. High racial socialization and parent relations were associated with lower internalizing symptoms for youth with discrimination and heard violence, respectively. High academic involvement and parent relations were linked with higher internalizing symptoms for youth with discrimination and high parent relations were linked with higher anxiety for bullied youth. Racial socialization and parent relations may help offset the potential influence of discrimination and heard violence, respectively, for adolescents.

TI How dress codes criminalize males and sexualize females of color
SO PHI DELTA KAPPAN
LA English
DT Article
AB School dress codes have been making news as students speak out about the ways the standards appear to them to be unfair, particularly to girls and Black males. Girls' clothing choices are singled out for being overly revealing and a distraction to boys, while Black males' choices are perceived as being associated with criminality. The authors surveyed students and interviewed teachers at a midwestern high school to better understand their perspectives on dress code enforcement. The survey found that Black and multiracial students were disproportionately likely to be coded (spoken to by a school adult) or disciplined for dress code violations.

TI Determinants of Intent to Transfer Among Black Male Community College
   Students: A Multinomial, Multilevel Investigation of Student Engagement
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID 2-YEAR
AB Background/Context. Transfer is a core function of community colleges; this is a critical point given that these institutions serve as the primary pathway into postsecondary education for Black men. However, too few Black men identify transfer as a primary goal and/or eventually transfer to a 4-year college or university.
   Purpose: Using Nora and Rendon's (1990) research on transfer predisposition as a theoretical guide, this study investigated determinants of Black male community college students' predisposition to transfer from a community college to a 4-year university. This research sought to determine whether student-level and institutional-level measures of engagement were predictive of transfer intent. This research also examined whether engagement predictors at the student level had randomly varying slopes across colleges.
   Population: This study employed a quantitative analysis of secondary data from the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE). A total of 11,384 Black men nested within 259 community colleges were included in the analytic sample.
   Research Design: Data were analyzed using multilevel, multinomial logistic regression. Students' predisposition to transfer was modeled in three categories, transfer as a primary goal, secondary goal, or not a goal. The first analysis examined predictors of students' intent to transfer using student-level variables while the second analysis added institutional-level variables. In the third analysis, the researchers' constructed random slopes and intercepts models to investigate whether the student-level engagement slopes on the outcome differed across the nested structure.
   Findings/Results: Students with transfer as a primary goal (as opposed to not being a goal) were more likely to be younger, have earned more credits, non-first-generation, full-time enrollees, and to have taken developmental education courses. They were also more likely to spend more hours per week studying and involved in extracurricular activities. These students were also more engaged in active and collaborative learning and used student services on campus.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This research has shown that that the factors influencing Black men's predisposition toward transfer largely mirror that of their White and Hispanic peers. Findings from this study demonstrated that social integration was a positive predictor of students' intent to transfer; the finding diverges from prior research on Black men in the community college, which have shown social integration to serve as a negative predictor of success outcomes.

AB Black autistic individuals, regardless of age, have not been centered in autism research. Instead, they often exist on the margins-on the periphery of autism research. In fact, Black autistic adults are largely absent from the literature. Most participants in autism research are majority-white autistic individuals and families. In this conceptual article, we use intersectionality and Dis/ability Studies and Critical Race Theory theories to contextualize Black autistic adults' experiences. Second, we argue that systemic disparities and methodological concerns are two contributors to the scholarly neglect of Black autistic adults in autism research. Third, we provide guidelines to support researchers in moving from neglect to inclusive research with Black autistic adults. Community brief Why is this topic important?The experiences of Black autistic adults are not well represented in research. The lack of cultural responsiveness in autism research ignores the nuanced experiences of Black autistic adults, which limits the ability to understand their experiences and effectively meet their needs. What is the purpose of this article?The purpose of this article is to highlight the void in autism research concerning Black autistic adults. This article is a call to action for research that is inclusive of Black autistic adults. Specifically, we (1) use intersectionality and Dis/ability Studies and Critical Race Theory theories to contextualize Black autistic adults' experiences, (2) describe the systemic disparities (e.g., health care) that contribute to the scholarly neglect of Black autistic adults, and (3) provide guidelines to support researchers in moving from neglect to inclusive research with Black autistic adults. What personal or professional perspectives do the authors bring to this topic?The first author identifies as a white, non-binary, doctoral student in Applied Developmental Science and Special Education. The second author identifies as a Black, cisgender female, Assistant Professor of Special Education. The third author identifies as a white, non-binary, autistic autism researcher. The fourth author identifies as a Black, cisgender male, doctoral student in Educational Equity. The fifth author identifies as a black, cisgender female, doctoral student in Educational Equity. The sixth author identifies as a Black, cisgender female, dual-licensed special education teacher, and doctoral student in Educational Equity. Although none of the authors embody the lived experience of being both Black and autistic, our research team is committed to supporting and advocating for Black autistic individuals through our ongoing professional development and dedication to strength-based, and identity-centered research. What is already known about this topic?Although we know about disparities in Black autistic children, little research has focused on the experiences of Black autistic adults. Most of what we know about autistic adults is based on the experiences of white participants. What do the authors recommend?First, we recommend that researchers work to understand how their own perspectives, values, and experiences shape their research (e.g., cultural reciprocity). Second, we recommend that researchers intentionally include the perspectives and experiences of Black autistic adults. This can include collaborating on research with Black autistic scholars and highlighting autistic and Black autistic led research. Finally, we advocate for systemic changes in institutions of higher education (e.g.
   , reduce barriers to admission) and in communities (e.g., culturally responsive supports) to better address the inequities that impact the representation of Black autistic adults in autism research. How will these recommendations help autistic adults now or in the future?These recommendations will prepare researchers with strategies to effectively build partnerships with Black autistic adults in ways that honor their knowledge and contributions to the field. As a result, Black autistic adults will have more representation in autism research, both as participants and as leading scholars in the field. We hope that more inclusive representation of Black autistic adults will lead to more culturally responsive approaches in adult autism research.

AB This rich, arts- and spatial-thinking-integrated project examined the effects of making three-dimensional dioramas of traditional African cultures on Black fifth graders at an urban school on students' racial identities, knowledge of cultural universals, and spatial thinking skills. Pretest and posttest attitudes measured with the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity-Teen evidenced an increase in sense of belonging to other Black people. Students learned social studies content and recognized many cultural universals, allowing them to feel connected to the African groups. Student essays showed admiration for African cultures, connections through similar foods, and links through appreciation of animals.

AB This 2-year qualitative case study focuses on one emergent mathematics teacher leader, Mr. Miller, and his conceptualization of Social Justice Mathematics (SJM). SJM is a justice-oriented pedagogical approach where students simultaneously learn dominant mathematics and explore social injustices to take action toward justice. Using Rodriguez's (Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 1998, 35, 589-622) sociotransformative constructivism framework, findings illuminate how dialogic conversation, authentic activity, and metacognition supported Mr. Miller's reflexivity about his positionality, which he described as "upper middle class, highly educated parents, white, male," in relationship to his students' positionality. He taught in a public charter high school in an urban city in the Northeast United States, where approximately 60% of students identified as Black, 30% white, 10% mixed race, 1% Asian American, 1% Latine, and less than 1% Indigenous, with 60% of students qualifying for free or reduced lunch. The article discusses of the importance of reflexivity for teachers and teacher leaders of all backgrounds, and especially when educators of dominant backgrounds work with students of historically marginalized backgrounds. The article calls for further research with more experienced mathematics teacher leaders of various backgrounds and contexts to further investigate justice-centered mathematics teacher leadership.

TI Relational Teaching With Black Boys: Strategies for Learning at a
   Single-Sex Middle School for Boys of Color
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID STUDENTS
AB Background/Context: Positive teacher-student relationships are critical for Black boys' learning across single-sex and coeducational environments. Limited attention to these relationships by school professionals is rooted in deficit-oriented conceptions of boyhood and Black masculinity. The popular message of deficiency and pathology is clear: Black boys and men are either dangerous or at-risk and need to be saved. Such narrow conceptions are destructive, operate unconsciously, skew teachers' perceptions of who boys are, and distort teachers' efforts to meet boys' distinct learning needs. A "boy crisis" in U.S. education has been characterized by a set of distressing school outcomes in specific learning categories. Racial marginalization and poverty only serve to exacerbate these negative academic outcomes, whereby low-income Black boys remain in the bottom quartile across all achievement measures. Scholars have recently begun to partly attribute boys' underachievement to a lack of emphasis on the relational dimension of schools.
   Purpose/Focus of the Study: (1) Illustrate how a set of relational teaching strategies supported Black boys' engagement and learning, and (2) further contribute boys' "voice" to a counternarrative, which strives to complicate and dispel negative race and gender stereotypes associated with Black males in the United States.
   Setting/Population/Participants: This study employs a relational teaching framework to examine the learning relationships among teachers and a full cohort of eighth-grade Black boys (N = 27) at a single-sex middle school for boys of color in New York City.
   Research Design/Data Collection: In-depth interviews from a critical ethnography conducted at the school-site (2011-2012) culled boys' narratives of their teacher-student relationships.
   Findings/Discussion: Boys particularly expressed how teachers must foremost convey mastery of course content, with a lucid set of humane behavioral expectations. Narratives from the boys revealed how relationally effective teachers consistently enacted the following gestures: reaching out and go beyond; personal advocacy; establishing common ground; and accommodating opposition. Teachers demonstrated the capacity to acquire and refine relational gestures, but relationship struggles among the boys and their teachers were commonplace. Core findings include: (a) Boys illuminated how specific aspects of the school context facilitated successful enactment of the relational teaching strategies by teachers; (b) teachers' use of the relational strategies was also facilitated by the social categories of race, gender, and class the boys embodied; (c) boys' engagement and learning benefitted from positive teacher-student relationships, which ensued after effective use of the relational teaching strategies; and (d) relational teaching with Black boys is not limited to either single-sex or coeducational learning environments.

AB The current study examined patterns of Black adolescent boys' socioemotional competence (SEC) in the midst of racial (in)congruence of their neighborhood and school contexts and the associations of these patterns with self- and teacher-reported social adjustment. Data collected from 417 Black adolescent boys in 7th-11th grade were analyzed using a multilevel class analysis to derive student-level classes of SEC and neighborhood racial composition and school-level classes of school racial composition. Class associations with social adjustment were examined via analysis of variance and analysis of covariance among a subsample of 258 Black males. Four patterns of SEC-neighborhood racial composition and two patterns of school racial composition were identified; the former were associated with self- and teacher-reported social adjustment. Interactive patterns of SEC-neighborhood racial composition classes and school racial composition classes were associated with teachers' reports of negative social adjustment. Study findings suggest that considering SEC within racialized contexts is important for understanding Black adolescent boys' adjustment.

AB Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to garner the perspectives of teaching for social justice (TSJ) and teacher education for social justice from individuals who were previously or currently are affiliated with physical education teacher education (PETE) programs at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). A second purpose was to elucidate the meaning of TSJ as it pertains to PETE faculty who were once students of color at HBCUs. Participants: The participants were five Black Americans (three men and two women) alumni of HBCUs. Method: The research design was descriptive-qualitative using an interviewing approach for data collection, which also included artifact analysis. (Gay, 1996). Specifically, primary data were collected through semistructured in depth interviews. Data analysis occurred through the usage of immersion. Results: The emergent themes were: mainstreaming and maintaining, intergenerational justice, and different and divergent. Conclusion: Results of this study indicate that: the nature of social justice is contextual; HBCUs prepare students to teach within both the mainstream and Black communities; and that values and practices related to social justice are passed from teacher educator to teacher education student.

AB Background/Context: Embedded in "common sense" and state-mandated reforms to close "the achievement gap," the urban school, especially those sites with a no-excuses orientation to learning, can produce and reproduce the carceral state in students' lives. The seemingly innocuous policies and processes limit access to educational opportunities and create disproportionate out-of-class time, which can emerge as the connective tissue for criminalization and the school-to-prison nexus that disproportionately affects Black males in the United States. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The objective of the study was to illuminate the more unspoken mechanisms of disproportionality in school while concurrently raising awareness of how everyday practices, like school-imposed mis/labeling, contribute to the symbolic violence and dehumanization of Black and Latinx boys in school. Research Design: The article includes purposeful observations and semi-structured interview data with school personnel and students drawn from a 14-month ethnographic study. Findings/Results: The findings from this study revealed that the mechanisms of disproportionality ranged from explicit anti-Black policies to more tacit systems and processes, but all reflected how the no-excuses environment contributes to the connective tissue of criminalization and the school-to-prison nexus for boys of Color. The finding centers on three systems and policies that are influenced by carceral logic and the enforcement of student alienation. Conclusion/Recommendations: The findings from the study reveal the need for a radical transformation of no-excuses public charter schools, one that is community-based and rooted in an Afrocentric education. If educators and other school personnel are working in tandem with community members, they can reassess their negative misperceptions of minoritized communities that begin to shape infractions rooted in anti-Blackness. A community-based approach can begin to dismantle the school-to-prison nexus. Furthermore, an Afrocentric education approach requires school personnel to understand the history and culture of people of African descent and to see students' full humanity. Here, students' lived experiences would be centered within the diaspora, while sociocultural norms that may have been criminalized in the past would be valued and accepted.

TI Black Students in Handcuffs: Addressing Racial Disproportionality in
   School Discipline for Students With Dis/abilities
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Although there are federal protections for students with dis/abilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 1975, Black students with and without dis/abilities continue to be suspended and expelled at rates that exceed their peers. Still, there is limited research on how Black girls and Black boys are disciplined across suspension types, and based on their identification for special education services. The purpose of this article is to examine the overrepresentation of Black girls and Black boys with and without dis/abilities and to determine, using a quantifiable percentage, how the overrepresentation of Black students for in-school and out-of-school suspension can be eradicated. We use data from the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection 2011-2012 to examine equity (justice and fairness) in disciplinary referrals using state-by-state and regional data. Using an equity formula, we analyzed national data to determine the magnitude of Black females' and Black males' overrepresentation in in-school and out-of school suspensions for students with and without dis/abilities. This study indicates that Black females with dis/abilities had the highest rate of overrepresentation in the Midwest in in-school and out-of-school suspension. In comparison, Black males experienced a greater representation in in-school suspension. Regardless of geographic area Black girls and Black boys are continuously being overrepresented in disciplinary punishments. To end the overrepresentation of Black girls and Black boys in in-school and out-of-school suspensions, schools and policy makers must collaborate with communities of color, eliminate teacher implicit and explicit racial biases, and discontinue racially punitive school policies.

AB In this Black feminist critical inquiry, I theorize the politics of race, gender, and geography in the context of a liberatory Black pedagogical space located in the United States. Using curated interview and observation data, I position an anti-racist pedagogue as a cartographer who employed method, content, style, and technique to map freedom routes away from schooling, a Dumasian site of suffering for Black students. I paint a narrative portrait that foregrounds sights, sounds, and felt tensions emerging from two manifestations of Black affective networks that constellated in the Black male critical pedagogue's classroom. Ultimately, I call for attention to the construction of liberatory education spaces created to address the comfort and needs of not only racially minoritized learners but also students who embody sexes, genders, and gender performances marginalized in white-dominant culture. Such pedagogical spaces, I argue, can be a refusal to indulge the ontological, epistemological, and existential project of whiteness.

AB Although students must successfully navigate transition years in school in pursuit of sustained academic success, not enough is known about the context-linked experiences of African American male adolescents as they seek to traverse their senior year, one of the most important pivotal points in time for all students. This study examined the relationship between perceptions of support from significant others, exposure to contextual risks, and two achievement outcomes in a representative sample of 139 African American male high school seniors. At this critical juncture in their education career, teacher support was predictive of higher grade point average (GPA), and a specific type of family support was associated with lower GPA. Qualitative analysis revealed similarities and differences in types of support reported to have had an impact on the participants' success in school. Results from the study confirm one hypothesis that exposure to contextual risks predicts poorer achievement outcomes. Findings affirm the need for tailored interventions that target and strengthen the systems of support within the social environment of academically at-risk African American male students.

ID COUNSELORS
AB Purpose - This paper aims to examine the role of school stakeholders (e.g. advisory board members, school administrators, parents, teachers and school board members) at a 99% black academy in promoting the achievement and broadening participation of high school black students in engineering career pathways.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors followed a qualitative case study design to explore the experiences of school stakeholders (e.g. students, district and school personnel and community partners) associated with the implementation of the career academy (Stake, 2006; Yin, 1994).
   Findings - The authors found that the school relied heavily on the support of the community in the form of an advisory board - including university faculty and industry leaders - to actively develop culturally responsive strategies (e.g. American College Test preparation, work-based learning opportunities) to ensure the success of black students interested in pursuing career pathways in engineering. Thus, school stakeholders in the academy of engineering served as authentic leaders who inspired academy students by serving as role models and setting examples through what they do as engineering professionals. It was quite evident that the joy and fulfillment that these authentic leaders gained from using their talents directly or indirectly inspired students in the academy to seek out and cultivate the talents they are good at and passionate about as well (Debebe, 2017). Moreover, the career academy provided environmental or sociocultural conditions that promoted the development of learners' gifts and talents (Plucker and Barab, 2005). Within that context, the goals of career academy school stakeholders were to support students in the discovery of what they are good at doing and to structure their educational experiences to cultivate their gifts into talents.
   Research limitations/implications - It is also important to acknowledge that this study is not generalizable to the one million career academy students across the nation. Yet, the authors believe researchers should continue to examine the career academy advisory board as a source of capital for engaging and preparing diverse learners for success post-high school. Further research is needed to investigate how advisory boards support students' in school and postsecondary outcomes, particularly for diverse students.
   Practical implications - The authors highlight promising practices for schools to implement in establishing a diverse talent pipeline.
   Social implications - On a theoretical level, the authors found important insights into the possibility of black students benefiting from a culturally responsive advisory board that provided social and cultural capital (e.g. aspirational, navigational and social) resources for their success.
   Originality/value - While prior researchers have studied the positive impact of teachers in career academies as a contributor to social capital for students (Lanford and Maruco, 2019) and what diverse students bring to the classroom as a form of capital Debebe(Yosso, 2005), research has not identified the role of the advisory board (in its efforts to connect the broader community) as a vehicle for equipping ethnically and racially diverse students who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds with social capital. Within that sense, the authors believe the advisory board at Stanton Academy relied on what the authors term local community capital to provide resources and supports for black students' successful transition from high school into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related college and career pathways.

ID CRITICAL RACE PEDAGOGY; MALE TEACHERS; MALE STUDENTS; SCHOOLS; POLITICS;

AB Black male teachers are consistently positioned in teacher recruitment and teacher education discourse as the potential solution to a myriad of social and educational problems. However, the expectations of Black male performance are at times predicated on limiting and oppressive assumptions. In this qualitative study, the authors use the Black feminist tenet, heteropatriarchy, to examine the life histories of two Black male teacher candidates and one Black male teacher in order to convey the problematic relationship among racial and gendered stereotypes, professional identities, and classroom experiences. Our findings suggest that the expectations Black male educators perceive others to hold of them do not leave space for diverse expressions of racial, gendered, and sexual identities. We conclude by offering recommendations toward identifying and challenging themes of heteropatriarchy within the social, cultural, and professional expectations communicated to Black male teacher candidates and teachers.

AB Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 2011 (n = 14,370; 51% Male; 51% White; 14% Black; 25% Hispanic; 4% Asian; and 6% Other), this study examined the cumulative, timing-specific, and enduring associations between student-teacher relationships in the United States and a broad range of student outcomes. Student-teacher conflict and closeness were consistently associated with outcomes between kindergarten and third grade, both contemporaneously and over time. The main exception was for student absenteeism, where there were less consistent associations with student-teacher conflict. Cumulative models underscore the significance of the overall experiences of high-quality relationships over time. Despite little evidence of variability, girls fared less well socially due to more conflictual and less close relationships with their teachers than boys.

AB This article's primary interest is an exploration of the complexities of educational and social conditions encountered by African American males in public schools. It focuses on the ability and effectiveness of comprehensive school reform to overcome the barriers to learning that hinder the urban Black male student, such as concentrated poverty, drug use, and violence. Current trends in comprehensive school reform tend to overlook the importance of cultural relevancy and student/teacher cultural synchronization in educating Black males. As such, this article argues that efforts for the reform of policy and practice be conjoined with the recruitment of educators and school staff. Specifically, this article addresses the effectiveness of recruiting well-educated African American male teachers to teach in schools with large populations of African American male students.

AB This study explores HIV risk in a small group of Black African women school teachers in South Africa. We used a two-part questionnaire with inductive thematic analysis to explore their private and personal sexual attitudes, as well as their perceptions of male attitudes about sexuality. Key themes are: a desire for power over personal choices, submission to male control in sexual relationships, HIV concern, and the high value these women place on sexual relationships. Although they understood the mechanisms for HIV transmission and enjoyed a degree of financial independence, some of their efforts to avoid HIV risk in sexual relationships, as well as their efforts to communicate about sexuality, were compromised by gendered power dynamics. The results from this study also highlight some gendered strategies they use to preserve their health and relationships. We conclude that an intersectional approach best addresses the problem of preventing HIV/AIDS within an inflexible post-colonial patriarchal structure.

AB We investigated 130 Black and Latino college students regarding their concerns, attitudes toward professional counseling, sources of support, and coping activities. We found that the Black and Latino cultural emphasis on interdependence influenced attitudes toward using professional resources such as a counselor. We also found a significant two-way interaction between gender and race for attitudes toward professional counseling: Black males had less favorable attitudes in comparison to Black females, while Latino males had more favorable attitudes than did Latino females. Both Black and Latino college students had favorable attitudes toward informal support networks. Differences between Black and Latino college students were found for reported concerns and coping sources. Implications for counseling theory, practice, and research are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND Urban black adolescents' wellbeing in the early high school years can be negatively impacted by exposure to racial discrimination. These impacts may be buffered by supportive relationships with adults at school. We considered both the protective and promotive effects of culturally responsive teachers and caring school police on school engagement for students exposed to racial discrimination across settings.
   METHOD This study leveraged baseline student report from a sample of urban, predominantly black high school students with elevated teacher-rated levels of aggressive behavior (N = 397 9th graders; 91.2% black; 50.4% male; J = 10 schools). Using a path model with full-information maximum likelihood estimation, we examined the associations of racial discrimination, teacher cultural responsiveness, and school police caring in relation to school engagement and school disconnection, adjusting for covariates, including family racial socialization.
   RESULTS Frequency of racial discrimination was significantly associated with lower school engagement and greater school disconnection. Teacher cultural responsiveness was significantly, favorably associated with all outcomes. Police caring had no significant direct associations; however, there were moderation effects. When police caring was below average, increased racial discrimination was associated with significantly poorer attitudes toward school.
   CONCLUSIONS Findings suggested that students' perceptions of school police caring may buffer links between racial discrimination experiences and school disconnection. Moreover, students who perceive that their teachers are culturally responsive may feel more engaged at school. Interventions to promote teachers' and school police officers' cultural responsiveness and caring may improve engagement among at-risk urban youth who experience racial discrimination.

AB This paper calculates the public savings (financial benefits) from greater public investments in the education of African-American males. Over one-fifth of each age cohort of black males in US is not a high school graduate. We identify five interventions that would-based on credible research-increase the graduation rate; we also report the public cost of each intervention. We then calculate the lifetime public benefits in terms of increased tax revenues and lower spending oil health and crime. In present values, for a black male aged 20, these public benefits amount to $256,700 per new graduate and the median intervention would cost only $90,700. The benefit/cost ratio is 2.83. Simply equating the high school graduation rate of black males with that of white males would yield public savings of $3.98 billion for each age cohort. These results suggest that increased investments in education for black males at risk of dropping out of high school should be an economic priority. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this literature review was to ascertain the concerns of White fathers raising their biological Black-White biracial sons, as well as the concerns of the sons themselves. Nine databases were selected for this review. The criteria for this review were (a) studies with a sample or subsample of White fathers, (b) studies with a subsample of Black-White biracial male participants (c) articles from scholarly peer reviewed journals, and (d) a date range between 2000 and 2016. A total of eight articles were found that matched the criteria. Of the eight studies, seven were qualitative with the number of participants ranging from 10 to 31, and the quantitative study had 317 participants. Three concerns were revealed for White fathers: dealing with racism, access to minority culture, and teachers' expectations. Three challenges for the sons were self-identification, force-choice dilemma, and appearance. Implications and future research are discussed.

AB Physical Activity is an important contributor to health, both physical and cognitive. The relationship between physical activity and educational outcomes has been explored in a variety of venues. Little research, however, has recently interrogated this subject longitudinally, and especially for a national sample of Black students. To address that gap, this paper employs data from the High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS), hierarchical regression modeling, and intersectionality theory to evaluate the relative impact of extracurricular activities, school attitudes, and the impact of demographics on the Personal Health and Physical Education Grade Point Average of over 1,000 Black high school students. The High School Longitudinal Study is a nationally representative, longitudinal study of ninth graders followed through their secondary and postsecondary years. Further, we examined the results separately for male and female students, in order to achieve a better understanding of physical activity and academic achievement from the female perspective. Our findings reinforce the importance of participating in sports and extracurricular activities in fostering positive educational outcomes for Black students, male and female, nationally. Finally, recommendations are offered to parents, community leaders, teachers, school administrators, and policy makers regarding implementation strategies to optimize the benefits of Physical Activity to Black adolescents.

AB This study explored how student engagement was related to perceived teacher autonomy support and self-determination skill expression among 145 Grades 9 through 12 African American high school students. First, we examined differences between male and female students' engagement, perceived teacher autonomy support, and self-determination skill expression. Results indicated that male and female students did not report significant differences in the extent to which they were engaged in class, perceived their teachers as supporting their autonomy, and expressed indicators of self-determination. Second, regression analysis indicated that perceived teacher autonomy support and self-determination skill expression were significant, positive predictors of students' engagement in class. An additional mediation model demonstrated that self-determination skill expression mediated the relationship between perceived teacher autonomy support and student engagement. Strategies for supporting African American high school students' autonomy and self-determination skill expression are provided, as well as limitations and directions for future research.

AB Literature suggests that culturally promotive curricula can counter the effect of anti-Blackness in United States (U.S.) schools by cultivating Black students' cultural, social, and academic development and fostering learning environments in which they feel respected, connected, and invested in their school communities. However, Black students, especially young Black men, who return to school following a period of incarceration, face discrimination and numerous barriers to school reentry and engagement. While some enroll in alternative schools as a last option to earn a diploma, little is known about how curricula in these educational settings can facilitate positive school reentry experiences and outcomes among this population. As such, this intrinsic qualitative case study explored how one alternative school's culturally promotive curriculum fosters and cultivates educational resilience among formerly incarcerated young Black men. Data collection included observations, interviews, and document reviews, and utilized a thematic analytic approach that included grounded theory techniques. Results indicate that teaching content that formerly incarcerated young Black men perceived as truthful and relevant to their lived experiences augmented their school engagement. The young men reported feeling empowered by the school's curriculum structure and culture that allowed them to self-direct learning goals and course content toward themes that affirmed their cultural and social identities. The curriculum also appeared to facilitate positive relationships with the instructors, leading to the development of a positive school climate where the young men felt safe, appreciated, and supported. These findings highlight the important role space, place, and relationships can play in bolstering formerly incarcerated young Black men's educational resilience through a culturally promotive curriculum in the context of an alternative school.

AB In this article, co-written by a self-identified White female professor and a self-identified Black male doctoral student, the authors address the pressing need to train and retain a teacher workforce willing and able to foster equity for students from nondominant racial, ethnic, and linguistic backgrounds. They make three arguments. First, the impact of educator work is deeply entwined with student and teacher identities as well as the cultural knowledges, histories, and experiences that students and teachers bring to classrooms. Second, professional knowledge must be interdisciplinary, drawing on a number of social science and humanities disciplines to inform practice and ongoing inquiry in practice. Third, the critical shortage of research on the interaction between individual and collective educator identities and teacher learning must be addressed. The authors conclude with a call to regroup the preparation of all educators, including special educators, to become more explicit and present in discourse about ability, race, gender, sexuality, and other identity markers. Both discourse and curricula need to represent and educate our nation's students about the rich tapestry of diversity that manifests in multiple forms of knowledge, social, political, and intellectual capital. The teacher workforce needs to be prepared and supported to do this work.

AB Background/Context: On January 29, 2008 the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) approved a city-wide Africentric elementary school under their Alternative School policy, sparking a contentious debate. Calls for Black-focused schools also arose in 2008 in London in response to the disengagement of African Caribbean youth. The historical record indicates, however, that community campaigns for Black educational programs stretch back over 40 years in both cities.
   Focus of the Study: This paper analyzes the development of Black-focused education in Toronto and London from 1968 to 2008 through the responses of Black parents and community activists to the historic underachievement of African Caribbean students (particularly males) in the public schools of both cities. Black-focused education is situated within the larger social, political, and national contexts and the critical incidents that fueled the development of race equality policy. The article explores how the "politics of place" influenced the trajectory of Black-focused education in each city.
   Research Methodology: Two parallel historical case studies were conducted using primary source material from community-based archives, secondary sources on the history of African Caribbean immigration and the development of Black community organizations, and oral history interviews with 10 Black education activists in Toronto and 7 activists in London.
   Conclusions: This comparative study conceptualizes this transnational phenomena as "resistance to racism" and examines how Black-focused curriculum and ideology was adapted to local conditions in Canada and Britain. Parents and community activists aimed to develop the citizenship rights of African Caribbean students, establish a diasporic sensibility, and promote the right of children of African descent to a quality education wherever they may reside.

AB The challenge of opening the doors to science has been a topic of debate for many years. This content analysis study documented an urban school's attempt to use representational practices to promote positive science identities for African American boys. Our analysis revealed how the school attempted to offer connections between ethnic identity and achievement ideology through representational practices. Whether it was posting the names of famous African American male scientists or promoting attendance to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), the school used postings, displays, and interior pictures to communicate a positive science identity. The study highlights the need to promote non-stereotypical science identities for students.

AB Few Asian American men choose to become teachers in the United States, and the career paths of those who do are not well understood. Guided by Situated Expectancy-Value Theory, analyses of interviews with 12 Asian American male preservice teachers revealed three themes. First, men navigated social discouragement and variable parental support for a teaching career. Second, their career decisions were grounded in commitments to personal agency, non-conformity, and making a social contribution. Third, career exploration, including early teaching experiences and exploring non-teaching career possibilities, clarified strengths and values. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Background/Context: Previous research suggested that first- or second-generation African immigrants comprised nearly a third of Black students attending selective U.S. colleges. While research frames the involvement of Black immigrant collegians as distinctly different from African American peers as it pertains to family goals, relationships, ethnic identity, and academic achievement, little is known about the ways in which Black immigrant collegians experience the perceptions of others about their literacy achievement in the academy.
   Purpose and Research Design: This qualitative narrative inquiry applies CRiT walking in concert with translanguaging to examine the epistemological perspectives of six second-generation immigrant African male collegians experiencing structural placism and using academic literacies as they traverse a Hispanic-serving institution in rural Texas.
   Conclusion: Structural racism excludes students of color from learning and leadership opportunities at predominantly White institutions. Our findings show that participants who used translanguaging by invoking two specific forms of linguistic repertoires, English standardized and cultural nonstandardized, to proactively respond to structural placism. Furthermore, participants associated being multilingual with race and leadership positionality in academic, organizational and cultural spaces. Moreover; African immigrant male collegians spoke of utilizing racially homogenous academic (e.g., study groups) and historically Black cocurricular organizations as spaces to engage in culturally safe ways that validated their intellectual and ethnic identities.

AB This case study tells the story of Geneva Wilson, an African American teacher of British literature. The study positions the entirely White male curriculum and Geneva's Black female body as texts that embody oppositional dominant and nondominant Discourses. Findings reveal a contentious relationship between the categorical canonicity Geneva experienced, and was required to teach, and her body. Intertextual frictions complicated the culturally responsive practices she felt efficacious in actualizing. Geneva mitigated Discoursal incongruences by performing a secondary dominant Discourse and designing subversively culturally responsive experiences for her students. The study highlights the need to nuance and particularize the effects of canonicity and to situate investigations of White male curricula relative to literacy teachers' storied existences and contextually specific teaching experiences.

TI "To Not Be a Traitor of Black English": Youth Perceptions of Language
   Rights in an Urban Context
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID STUDENTS RIGHT; OWN-LANGUAGE; AFRICAN; LITERACY; SCHOOL; COMMUNITY;
   POLITICS
AB Background/Context: Although progress has been made since members of the Conference on College Composition and Communication passed the Students' Right to Their Own Language resolution (1974), there still remains a demand to examine youth perceptions of language. Such examinations can help teachers and researchers improve curricular choices, honor the lived experiences of students in classrooms, and address a systemic problem within a larger sociopolitical context: the continued failure of American public schooling to adequately educate Black students and other students of color.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Questions/Focus of Study: The primary purpose of this article is to detail how youth perceive language rights in their academic and community lives, particularly in relation to what they name "Black English" and "Academic English." To understand youth language perceptions, this article is guided by the following inquiry: Given the historically dichotomous relationship between Black English and Academic English, how do youth perceive language in their struggle to acquire academic success?
   Setting: Data for this ethnographic project, which derive from a larger ongoing multiyear study on youth representations of community and literacy, were collected from two African American teenage males who reside in or near New York City's Harlem community and who graduated from the Harlem High School of New York City and currently attend local colleges in the area.
   Research Design: The article uses a case study design to examine youth perceptions of language in their struggle to acquire academic success. Data for this study were collected from the following sources: researcher field notes, classroom observations, audio- and videotaped "rap" sessions, formal and informal interview meetings, participants' written responses to and verbal conversations on a series of 10 questions that we collaboratively designed over a 3-month period, and data member checking sessions.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings presented in this article highlight the potential for additional research on youth perceptions of language in relation to success and survival. Given current debates in educational research on student achievement, multiple perspectives, and the intersections of students' lived experiences with pedagogical practices and teacher training, teachers and researchers should continue to identify the ways in which student voices, writings, and experiences are oftentimes excluded from schools. Students' Right to Their Own Language is an important policy statement that questions U. S. monolingualism in multicultural, multilingual contexts.

AB In this essay, Roderick L. Carey draws from social-psychological perspectives on mattering to argue that Black boys and young men have yet to achieve comprehensive mattering in social and educational contexts. Positing that Black boys and young men . find their social and school lives framed by marginal mattering, which is realized through social and educational practices that criminalize, dismiss, and propel them into school failure, and partial mattering, where only some of their skills and abilities are cultivated and heralded, Carey contends that due to neoliberal reforms and stakeholders' structural incapacities to imagine and do otherwise, educators fail to construct contexts in which Black boys and young men can robustly infer their comprehensive mattering. Thus, educators and researchers miss relational opportunities to support Black boys and young men in imagining alternative lives that compel their fullness of interests, latent talents, and subsequent worth.

AB This study focuses on the perceptions and professional practice of Black and White teachers in a high poverty, predominately Latino elementary school in the suburban US South. The investigation explored how successful practitioners negotiated student disciplinary concerns within their classrooms. Race and gender gaps were documented in three of the four participants' classrooms as Black males were over-represented on behavioral sanctions in two classes while Asian and Hispanic males were disciplined at a disproportionately high rate in the third. When discipline gaps were documented, the disparities were associated with students' language status and grade level. The role of contextual factors in facilitating the study's findings is highlighted and implications for theory and educational practice are discussed.

AB Students' college aspirations precede any decision they may make to apply and enroll in college. College aspirations broadly refer to the formal development of specific plans made by a young person to position themselves to enroll in a four-year college or university after high school. Regular, ongoing interaction with college-educated adults is one important approach for transmitting messages that positively influence young people's college aspirations. This article is an examination of young Black men's descriptions of their interactions with adult stakeholders (e. g., administrators, teachers, professional support staff, etc.), and the influence of those interactions on shaping these young men's ambitions to attend college. Data sources for this phenomenological study include one semi-structured in-depth interview with ten college-aged young Black men from a large midwestern city. Findings reveal the significance of care in adult stakeholder-student interactions, and specific messages about college, for sparking these young Black men's aspirations to attend a four-year college or university. The implications of interactions with youth of color that translate culturally responsive versions of care are discussed.

AB This study is based on an initiative for increasing college and career readiness for Black and Latino male high school students in New York City. From data that include 58 total hours of participant observations from 24 educators of color, written documentation from culturally relevant education-professional development (CRE-PD) activities, and transcripts of six group interviews, we examine these educators' work to further their own sociopolitical consciousness in relation to increasing Black and Latino male students' college and career readiness. We explore how secondary educators of color utilize pedagogical tools and practices in attempting to support their Black and Latino male students' navigation of particular inequities related to college knowledge and access. Our findings highlight educators' experiential knowledge as a pedagogical tool, approaches to preparing students for postsecondary opportunities, and missed opportunities to enact a sociopolitical consciousness. Recommendations for inservice educator PD and future research are discussed.

AB BackgroundIndividual and collective prosocial competence can be fostered through high-quality interactions with program staff in out-of-school time environments.ObjectiveWe explored whether the social-emotional competencies of teachers working in an out-of-school STEM program infused with social emotional learning content were associated with school children's prosocial behavior, community engagement, and peer problems and whether these associations were moderated by social justice teaching beliefs and child gender.MethodParticipants were 126 students (72 male). Forty-one were White, 40 were Black, 34 were Latine, and 11 were Asian and most of them were third graders (Mage = 8.11 years). Teachers rated their emotional competence, commitment to social emotional learning, and social justice teaching beliefs. They also provided ratings of children's prosocial behavior and peer problems. Students provided ratings of their community engagement.ResultsTeachers' emotional competence was negatively associated with prosocial behavior, but only when their social justice teaching beliefs were low. However, teachers' commitment to social emotional learning was positively related to prosocial behavior. Teachers' emotional competence was associated positively with peer problems, but only for girls, and was also related positively to community engagement.ConclusionsResults demonstrate associations between STEM teachers' social emotional learning competencies and social justice teaching beliefs in the development of students' prosocial competence and community engagement and provide directions for future research.

AB A positive school climate is strongly associated with enhanced student outcomes. With the disengagement of Black and Latinx youth living in poverty being at an all-time high, participation in sport-based youth development (SBYD) programs may enhance school climate, while capitalizing on existing interests.Purpose:The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a SBYD intervention on male students of color and school climate.Method:Using a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design, 32 male students of color (11 Black, 13 Latinx, 8 two or more races) participated in an SBYD intervention, twice a week for a total of 20 weeks (Ages 10-14,M= 11.46). School climate data were gathered at the beginning and the end of the school year. Student, teacher, and administrator focus groups and interviews were also conducted at the end of the year.Results:A statistically significant interaction was found between students who participated in the intervention and those who did not participate in the intervention, on school climate measuresF(1,74) = 15.00,p< .01, partial eta(2) = .17. Overall school climate scores were statistically significantly greater in the intervention group (F(1,74) = 19.22,p< .01, partial eta(2) = .20) at the end of the year. Focus group data also revealed themes of improved school connectedness, peer support, the acquisition of social/civic skills, and school engagement.Conclusions:A SBYD intervention may be a viable strategy to engage disconnected students and increase school climate perceptions, particularly among male students of color living in poverty.

DE Black female superintendent; achievement gap; Black feminist theory;

AB This article presents researcher reflections of a case study of a Black female deputy superintendent who made the value-driven decision to close the achievement gap in her district. I posit that she is an outlier because she is Black and female in a predominantly white male field of practice, she effectively closed the achievement gap through her knowledge of curriculum and teacher quality, and she allowed her standpoint, life experiences, and ethic of care to inform her decision-making, yielding unique success resolving an all too common problem in education -the inequity of educational opportunity. Using Black feminist theory and the ethic of care as a theoretical framework, I examine her positionality, values, and decision-making as a Black female educational leader. This reflective essay aims to advance Black feminist theory, while emphasizing the ethic of care, and contributing to the qualitative research literature on Black female superintendents.

AB Black people in the United States have and continue to pursue practices of communal bonding as well as cooperative-and-sharing economies, from the invisible institution of Black religion to underground activist collectives such as the African Blood Brotherhood. While many efforts were explicitly political, other organizations primarily emphasized socioeconomic advancement for its group members and the broader Black community. One such set of collectives that in many ways embodied both aims are Black Greek-letter Organizations. One of their enduring legacies is the ability to produce a unique and powerful sense of sisterhood and brotherhood. Through various processes, shared symbols, and cultural artifacts, Black fraternal organizations create a sense of camaraderie readily apparent to even lay observers. Yet, very few empirical studies have examined how fraternity men define and embody such brotherhood bonds. Thus, the purpose of the present study sought to fill these knowledge gaps by addressing the following research questions: (1) how do Black Christian fraternity men define and embody brotherhood? and (2) what social and emotional benefits do Black Christian fraternity men gain from brotherhood? Using qualitative data gathered through various techniques (i.e., semistructured interviews, photovoice and identity maps, focus groups, and Facebook observations), we describe the ways Black male members of this Christian fraternity embody brotherhood as accountability and co-construct a space for men to experience and benefit from intimacy.

   quality; computer science
ID RACE TEACHERS; STUDENTS
AB Little is known about the extent to which expansions of K-12 computer science (CS) have been equitable for students of different racial backgrounds and gender identities. Using longitudinal course-level data from all high schools in California between the 2003-2004 and 2018-2019 school years we find that 79% of high school students in California, including majorities of all racial groups, are enrolled in schools that offer CS, up from 45% in 2003. However, while male and female students are equally likely to attend schools that offer CS courses, CS courses represent a much smaller share of course enrollments for female students than for male students. Non-Asian students enroll in relatively few CS courses, and this is particularly true for Black, Hispanic, and Native American students. Race gaps in CS participation are to a substantial degree explicable in terms of access gaps, but gender gaps in CS participation are not. Different groups of students have access to CS teachers with similar observable qualifications, but CS teachers remain predominantly white and male. Consequently, white and male CS students are much more likely than other students to have same-race or same-gender instructors. Our findings and the implications we draw for practice will be of interest to administrators and policymakers who, over and above needing to ensure equitable access to CS courses for students, need to attend carefully to equity-related course participation and staffing considerations.

TI Moving toward stronger advising practices: How Black males' experiences

AB Background: Graduate education provides students with specialized skills needed to advance science and discovery and prepares future educators and role models for future generations of learners. Given the importance of graduate education, the estimate that more than half of the students who begin it do not complete their degrees is troubling. Existing scholarship suggests that this substantial attrition from graduate school is in part due to inadequate advising. To address this concern, it is important to examine students' experiences with graduate advising. Purpose: This article presents a new model-the Model of Wholeness in Graduate Advising (MWGA)-that characterizes a range of students' advising experiences. In so doing, it encourages faculty to move toward a more caring and wholeness-promoting framework in graduate advising. Research Design: To better understand the complexities of graduate advising and the various types of experiences-and relationships-that students have, desire, expect, and need to thrive both professionally and personally, this study included interviews with 42 Black male graduate students attending historically and predominantly White institutions (HPWIs). Thematic analysis revealed that students' advising experiences included aspects of "ethics of care" (or degrees of care: whole, partial, empty). Iterative analysis of data led to the creation of the practice-informing model: the Model of Wholeness in Graduate Advising (MWGA). Findings: Although some students described experiencing positive interactions and teachable moments with their advisors, others painted pictures of demoralizing encounters and public shaming practices. Still others described advising experiences they did not have but would want. Accounting for this range, the MWGA denotes an upwardly moving relationship between degrees of care (i.e., empty, partial, whole) and students' perceptions of their advising experiences and relationships (i.e., weak, basic, strong) in part shaped by students' expectations for their advising experiences and relationships, and their lived experiences. Conclusions and Recommendations: The findings from this study, represented in the MWGA, illustrate theoretical linkages between students' expectations of advising, the levels of their advising experiences and relationships, and degrees of care demonstrated by their advisors. Most notably, more elements of care tend to result in better lived advising experiences and relationships. For current and future faculty, moving toward a more caring and wholeness-promoting framework might start with recognizing the needs of students as whole people. Creating more caring advising experiences and developing more caring relationships may better assist students in progressing through degree completion, and doing so more fully whole.

AB Researchers have revisited the influence of African American English many times within extant scholarship over the past 4 decades. However, the resulting pedagogical developments within teacher training programs are inadequate. Through a survey of literature of relevant topics, this article provides a framework regarding training for preservice teachers to ensure that they understand the historical intersectionality of race, gender, and language, especially when educating African American males. We believe the dismal underperformance of African American males and their significant disproportionality in special education should enliven the focus of reform efforts on the instructional and dispositions toward nonstandard English, such as African American English, which influence the fidelity of instruction.

TI Surprise, Sensemaking, and Success in the First College Year: Black
   Undergraduate Men's Academic Adjustment Experiences

AB Background: Much has been written about Black undergraduate men's out-of-class engagement and social experiences, identity development, participation in intercollegiate athletics, and college enrollment and completion rates. Too little is known about their academic readiness and first-year college adjustment.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to understand Black male students' academic transition experiences in the first college year, with a particular emphasis on how they resolved academic challenges with which they were confronted.
   Setting: This study was conducted at 42 colleges and universities in 20 states across the United States. Six institution types were included: private liberal arts colleges, public research universities, highly selective private research universities, public and private Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and comprehensive state universities.
   Participants: The sample was comprised of 219 Black undergraduate men, mostly juniors and seniors, who maintained high cumulative grade point averages, were extraordinarily engaged in a range of student organizations, held multiple leadership roles on campus, cultivated meaningful relationships with faculty and administrators, participated in enriching educational experiences (e.g., study abroad programs), and earned numerous merit-based awards and honors for their college achievements.
   Research Design: Qualitative research methods were used in this study. Specifically, phenom-enology was used to understand what Black male students experienced in the first college year and how they experienced the transition phenomenon.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Individual, face-to-face interviews were conducted with all 219 participants. Each interview was 2-3 hours. Moustakas' (1994) process for phenom-enological data analysis and Harper's (2007) trajectory analysis technique were used to analyze data collected for this study.
   Findings: Two thematic categories of findings are presented in this article. First are reflections from students who experienced turbulence in their transitions from high school to higher education. Being underprepared for the academic rigors of college, the surprising mismatch between academic effort and first-year grades, the racial composition dissimilarities between their high schools and college campuses, and feelings of cultural misfit were factors to which participants attributed their initial adjustment challenges. The second category includes insights from achievers who transitioned seamlessly to college. They attributed their successful starts to strong academic preparation, prior experiences in demographically comparable educational environments, participation in summer bridge and college transition programs, and academically profitable relationships they cultivated in student organizations.
   Recommendations: This article ends with several suggestions for helping Black undergraduate men adjust more seamlessly and resolve surprising academic transition issues encountered in the first college year.

TI "I'm Trying to Beat a Stereotype": Suburban African American Male
   Students' Social Supports and Personal Resources for Success in AP
   English Coursework
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article

AB Background: African American male students attending U.S. suburban schools remain severely underrepresented in Advanced Placement (AP) programs. A number of structural barriers, including racialized tracking policies; limited referrals from educators and school counselors; conventional AP practices centered on Eurocentric curricula, literature, and pedagogies; and educators' deficit mindsets toward Black masculinity, mitigate African American male students' access to and success in suburban AP classrooms. Despite these sobering realities, African American male students have achieved success in AP English Language Arts coursework. Yet few researchers have investigated the multiple and complex farms of support to which African American male students attribute their successful performance in AP English coursework in suburban high schools.
   Purpose/Research Question: In an effort to close opportunity gaps in AP English programs, the present study illuminates the social supports and personal resources that African American male students mobilized to earn exemplary grades (i.e., maintaining a grade of B- or higher,, or 79.6% or higher out of 100%) in an AP English Language and Composition and/or an English Literature and Composition course, and earn a passing score on the formal AP exam (i.e., 3 or higher). Countering deficit-oriented research paradigms, we employed an anti-deficit achievement framework to (re)position young African American men as capable. motivated, and agentive learners who marshal complex supportive networks, as well as their own personal resources, to successfully learn academic literacies in AP English classrooms. Our inquiry was guided by the following research question: To what social supports and personal resources do young African American men who graduated from a suburban high school attribute their success in AP English caursework?
   Participants: Eight young African American men who were enrolled in AP English coursework in a suburban Mid-Atlantic secondary school were the participants in this study. Participants were successful learners who received exemplary grades in an AP English class, were taught by the first author, and earned a passing score on an AP English exam. Participants' ages ranged from 21 to 33 years, and all were attending or had graduated from a four-year college or university.
   Research Design: The young men participated in one-on-one, in-depth interviews. Interviews probed the participants' personal experiences in AP English, their perspectives in achieving success in the class and on the formal exam, and their recollections of the AP English curriculum, and were cross-analyzed for common sources of supports through multiple coding cycles.
   Findings: The young men highlighted six sources of support that were integral to their AP English success. They described three sources of social supports-the wisdom, guidance, and caring that they received from family members, English teachers, and peers-that promoted their success in AP English. In addition, participants identified three types of personal resources-their own college aspirations, persistence in learning academic literacies, and racial consciousness-that inspired and motivated their high scholastic achievement in AP English.
   Conclusion: By mobilizing the rich social supports and personal resources in their lives, African American male students have the resilience, courage, and the intelligence to enroll and succeed in AP English coursework. We suggest that suburban school administrators, school counselors, and teachers use open AP enrollment policies; work closely with and provide pertinent information to African American families; address students' social emotional concerns; and ensure that AP English pedagogical practices are humanizing to improve the recruitment and retention of African American male students in AP English programs. Finally, we contend that educational scholars and practitioners must continue to engage in research and practice that nurture young African American male students' social supports and personal resources for AP English success.

AB To explore the role of teachers' biases in the underrepresentation of minorities and women in STEM, 128 secondary science teachers were asked to evaluate responses spoken with either falling or rising intonation by African American, Latino, and White ninth-grade boys and girls. Responses spoken by minority students were evaluated less favorably than identically worded responses spoken by White students, and rising intonation responses were evaluated less favorably than falling intonation responses. Female speakers have been shown to use rising intonation nearly twice as often as male speakers, so this bias against rising intonation responses disproportionately affects female students (an indirect effect of gender).

AB This research as per the reviewers addresses the guiding autoethnographic question: "What three key institutional incidents/conditions inform my Black scholar-activism for predominantly White education in this historical moment?" Moreover, it applies autoethnography to illuminate three key incidents/conditions involving: (1) predominantly White undergraduates; (2) top-level predominately White male university administrators; and (3) White school community leaders in this historical moment (i.e. within the last 4 years). The research as per the reviewers is organized to begin with a new poem and proceed to illuminate: (a) the current, observed historical context, (b) the application of critical race theory for illuminating my lived experiences of this context, (c) the rationale for applying autoethnography in this research as per the reviewers, and (d) the three key incidents/conditions. It concludes by returning to the guiding question, critical race theory, related implications and rationales.

AB The purpose of this paper is to engage the reader in a conversation about justice imperatives in education, disability, and health. As counternarrative to structured majoritarian scholarship and positioned in the expressed intent of the National Academy of Kinesiology's ' s 90th annual meeting theme of Kinesiology's ' s Social Justice Imperative, , we express feelings about the urgency for social justice in teacher education. To start, we operationally define fi ne social justice as advocacy, agency, and action. Next, we recommend the application of critical theoretical frameworks in conceptualizing and conducting research involving historically marginalized and minoritized populations (e.g., African American students). This conversation is theoretically grounded in intersectionality to offer a nuanced understanding of social constructions, such as ethnicity (e.g., African American) and race (e.g., Black), gender, culture, disability, and sociometric positioning regarding justice imperatives in education, disability, and health.

TI "Give a Brotha a Break!": The Experiences and Dilemmas of Middle-Class
   African American Male Students in White Suburban Schools
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID ETHNIC-IDENTITY; ACTING WHITE
AB Background/Context: Today, in the era of the first African American president, approximately one third of all African Americans live in suburban communities, and their children are attending suburban schools. Although most research on the education of African American students, particularly males, focuses on their plight in urban schooling, what occurs in suburban schools is also in need of examination.
   Purpose/Focus of Study: This research focused on the lived experiences of 4 middle-class African American male students attending affluent White suburban schools. Through vignettes focusing on their various experiences and recollections, this study provides a preliminary snapshot, part of a larger study, of the schooling environments in the life stories of middle-class Black suburban youth.
   Research Design: Qualitative methodology was used to explore the life histories of the 4 African American males. Each student participated in a tape-recorded interview to examine what it meant to grow up in White upper-middle-class suburban communities and to matriculate within suburban district schools from elementary through high school.
   Findings/Results: The salient themes that emerged from the rich, interactive conversations and dialoguing address issues related to disillusionment and resilience; the presence or absence of racism; academic pressures; social bonding and identity development in racialized social and academic settings; and the gatekeeping role of athletics.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Suburban education may not be the panacea that African American families had hoped. The socioeconomic status of African American families who live in affluent White suburban communities may not be enough to mitigate against the situated "otherness" that Black students-in this case, males-experienced in affluent White suburban schools. More research is needed to understand the positionality of Black male students in suburban schools; relationships between suburban Black adolescent males and females; school life beyond athletics; the role of the family and community in combating racism and otherness; and how student agency can be a force for change.

AB Hypertension remains a common public health challenge because of its prevalence and increase in co-morbid cardiovascular diseases. Black males have disproportionate pathophysiological consequences of hypertension compared with any other group in the United States. Alterations in arterial wall compliance and autonomic function often precede the onset of disease. Accordingly, our purpose was to investigate whether differences exist in arterial compliance and autonomic function between young, healthy African-American males without evidence of hypertension and age- and gender-matched non-African-American males. All procedures were carried out noninvasively following rest. Arterial compliance was calculated as the integrated area starting at the well-defined nadir of the incisura of the dicrotic notch to the end of diastole of the radial artery pulse wave. Power spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability provided distributions representative of parasympathetic and sympathetic modulations and sympathovagal balance. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated using the sequence method. Thirty-two African-American and twenty-nine non-African-American males were comparable in anthropometrics and negative family history of hypertension. t-Tests revealed lower arterial compliance (5.8 +/- 2.4 vs. 8.6 +/- 4.0 mmHg.s; P = 0.0017), parasympathetic modulation (8.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 9.7 +/- 1.1 ln ms(2); P = 0.0063), and BRS (13.7 +/- 7.3 vs. 21.1 +/- 8.5 ms/mmHg; P = 0.0007) and higher sympathovagal balance (2.9 +/- 3.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.1; P = 0.03) in the African-American group. In summary, differences exist in arterial compliance and autonomic balance in African-American males. These alterations may be antecedent markers of disease and valuable in the detection of degenerative cardiovascular processes in individuals at risk.

AB Recent research in writing with adolescents in out-of-school spaces provides insight into how young people learn to use writing to author their own lives. However, English language arts classrooms focus on correctness, form, and removing one selffrom the texts composed in school. For Black students in particular, these expectations for writing dehumanize students, decenter their voices and contributions to intellectual discourses, and invoke deficit perspectives about their writing abilities and linguistic identities. Using a critical stance on place, literacy, and humanity in order to examine how the literacy learning and practices of ELA classrooms/schools might (de)humanize and (de)culturize Black students, this study examines the writing pedagogy of a professor who taught a semester-long creative writing class for students at West High School. Through a humanizing approach to teaching writing, the professor and students engaged in writing and being in ways that honored as well as centered and supported their individual, cultural, and writerly identities. This article offers ways that teachers of writing might tap into Black intellectual traditions and invite students to use writing as a way to connect to what they do and learn while at school.

AB Black males, as one non-dominant population, remain underrepresented and less successful in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Researchers focused on non-dominant populations are advised against generalizations and to examine cultural intersections (i.e. race, ethnicity, gender, and more) and also to explore cases of success, in addition to cases of under-achievement and underrepresentation. This study has focused on one African American male, Randy, who expressed high-achieving STEM career goals in computer science and engineering. Furthermore, recognizing that culture and identity development underlie STEM engagement and persistence, this long-term case study focused on how Randy developed a STEM identity during the course of the study and the implications of that process for his STEM career exploration. Etienne Wenger's (1999) communities-of-practice (CoP) was employed as a theoretical framework and, in doing so, (1) the informal STEM program in which Randy participated was characterized as a STEM-for-social-justice CoP and (2) Randy participated in ways that consistently utilized an economics lens from beyond the boundaries of the CoP. In doing so, Randy functioned as a broker within the CoP and developed a non-traditional STEM identity-in-practice which integrated STEM, "economics", and community engagement. Randy's STEM identity-in-practice is discussed in terms of the contextual factors that support scientific identity development (Hazari et al. in J Res Sci Teach 47:978-1003, 2010), the importance of recognizing and supporting the development of holistic and non-traditional STEM identities, especially for diverse populations in STEM, and the implications of this new understanding of Randy's STEM identity for his long-term STEM career exploration.

AB We examined the relationships among collective self-esteem, perceived social support, and cultural congruity among 151 Black and Latino college students enrolled in predominantly White Midwestern state universities. We found that Black and Latino women reported higher levels of cultural congruity than did their male counterparts and that, after controlling for sex differences, higher public collective self-esteem and higher social support satisfaction were associated with higher cultural congruity scores. Implications of the findings for college student affairs personnel are discussed.

TI ARBITRARILY SELECTING BLACK ARBITRATORS
SO FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID MANDATORY ARBITRATION; SEXUAL-HARASSMENT; CLAIMS; RACE
AB Calls for increased diversity among arbitrators have surged with the growth of the employer movement, so-called mandatory arbitration, which requires employees to agree to arbitrate employment discrimination matters as a condition of employment. Despite good-faith efforts by neutral service providers, civil rights organizations, bar associations, and employer and employee groups to identify and address the need for more diverse arbitrators in mandatory arbitration, many commentators still lament that this diversity problem reflects negatively on access to justice. With the #MeToo movement's focus in recent years on the lack of a public and transparent resolution for sexual harassment matters, as well as rap music mogul Jay-Z's late 2018 effort to identify more black arbitrator candidates for his commercial arbitration matter, concerns about the lack of diversity among arbitrators have become even more prominent.
   However, the core of the problem remains: despite efforts to increase diversity in arbitrator pools, parties still have discretion to select the arbitrator. Businesses (and even, to some extent, employees) have no incentive to select an arbitrator solely because of the arbitrator's diversity profile. Representatives for businesses and employees want to win. They believe that result is best achieved by selecting arbitrators they know. Risk aversion prevents those representatives from selecting unfamiliar black and other nonwhite, male arbitrators, despite ongoing diversity efforts to populate arbitrator pools with more of these individuals.
   This Article explores how this "win first" dynamic hinders attempts to address arbitrator diversity and suggests a different approach by neutral service providers that mimics the selection of federal judges. This new selection process will involve the creation of a pool of diverse arbitrators with outstanding qualifications. Then, instead of having the parties choose the actual arbitrator, a neutral service provider will select the arbitrator assigned to the parties in a random manner, similar to how federal courts assign judges to cases without party input.

TI Neoliberal influence on Latino male identity: power and resistance in a
   school-based mentorship program for Latino boys
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE STUDIES IN EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Latino boys; boys of color; neoliberalism; school-based mentorship; role

AB A growing number of school district and community organizations are seeking to address a 'crisis' of Latino male education through the creation of Latino male mentorship programs. Indicative of neoliberal shifts in urban education, these programs often involve public-private partnerships and bring problem-solving, deficit-approaches to youth work. This article examines the construction of Latino male identity in one Latino male mentorship program. Drawing from two years of ethnographic research, I analyze the ways the perceived cultural deficits of Latino boys in the program are dictated by a neoliberal multicultural imaginary. This framing positioned the program as combating popular racial and heteropatriarchal deficits assigned to Latino boys. Furthermore, ethnographic data illustrate the ways the neoliberal values of meritocratic individualism, smart consumerism/market-orientation, and benevolent hetero-patriarchy were embodied and practiced. I close by highlighting moments of resistance and refusal enacted by one mentor to challenge deficit-framings of Latino male mentoring.

AB Data that are derived from high stakes testing in the United States have created rhetoric of fear and criticism around our public K-12 educational system. Stakeholders often blame these low-test scores on the school, administration, or teachers. Due to the way that this data is shared with the general public Different from this narrative, within many schools, high stakes testing data are reported in an aggregated fashion, usually by students' race. While the general public may be pointing their finger at schools, administrators, or teachers for poorly achieving students, these folks can quickly shift the blame to certain populations of students who are not performing well on standardized tests. Teachers spend time sorting and labeling children into groups and categories in an effort to fix the problem. While sometimes well intended, the planning, instruction, and assessment of daily and weekly instruction is focused on an end result of getting particular groups of students to score better on standardized tests. This article provides the counter narrative to this conversation and it strives to tell the story of a student who has fallen victim to standardized unauthentic curriculum. Multiple case study was the methodology used for this research. Consistent with this methodology, the data were gathered through one-on-one interviews, classroom observations, and small group discussions. Hardiman's model of White Identity Development (WID) and Freebody and Luke's four resources model were the conceptual frameworks that were used to guide the study. The findings shared in this article represent the data collected from one participant in this multiple case study.

AB Though treatment integrity measurement is important for research intended to promote social and behavioral outcomes of children at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders (EBDs) in early childhood settings, measurement gaps exist in the field. This paper reports on the development and preliminary psychometric assessment of the treatment integrity measure for early childhood settings (TIMECS), an observational measure designed to address existing measurement gaps related to treatment integrity with tier 2 interventions in the early childhood field. To assess the preliminary score reliability (interrater) and validity (construct, discriminant) of the TIMECS, live observations (N = 650) in early childhood classrooms from 54 teachers (92.6% female, 7.4% male; 61.1% White) and 91 children (M age = 4.53 years, SD = .44; 45.1% female, 54.9% male; 45.1% Black) at risk for EBDs were scored by 12 coders using the TIMECS and an observational measure designed to assess teacher-child interactions. Teachers also self-reported on the quality of the teacher-child relationship. Interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC [2,2]) for the quantity (i.e., adherence) item scores had a mean of .81 (SD = .07; range from .68 to .95), and the quality (i.e., competence) item scores had a mean of .69 (SD = .08; range from .52 to .80). Scores on the TIMECS Quantity and Quality items and scales showed evidence of construct validity, with the magnitude of the correlations suggesting that the quantity and quality items assess distinct components of treatment integrity. A TIMECS quantity scale also showed promise for intervention evaluation research by discriminating between teachers who had and had not been trained in a specific evidence-based intervention targeting social and behavioral skills in early childhood. The findings support the potential of the TIMECS to assess treatment integrity of teacher-delivered practices designed to address child social and behavioral outcomes of children at risk for EBDs in early childhood settings.

AB Our goals in this study were to examine (a) the degree to which teacher perceptions of children's behavior in kindergarten (averaged across fall and spring for each child) predict retention by Grade 5 and (b) whether these relationships are moderated by student race, gender, or socioeconomic status (SES). Data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) were used to examine how Externalizing Problem Behavior (EPB; e.g., aggression, defiance) and Weak Approaches To Learning (WATL; low enthusiasm for/engagement in learning) were related to retention among children identified as Black or White (N = 6,750). Results showed that both types of behavior ratings were significant predictors of retention. There was a 46% increase in the odds of retention for every one-unit increase in EPB (OR = 1.46, p < 0.001) and a 261% increase in the odds of retention for every one-unit increase in WATL (OR = 3.61, p < 0.001). Gender moderated the relationship between EPB and retention and WATL and retention. Students who were female with EPB or WATL were at higher risk for being retained than their male peers. Implications for educators, researchers, and policymakers are discussed.

TI Finding a Voice in Predominantly White Institutions: A Longitudinal
   Study of Black Women Faculty Members' Journeys Toward Tenure
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; GENDER; COLOR; GRADUATE; CLIMATE; SCHOOL
AB Background/Context: Amidst scholarship that underscores the importance of Black women faculty in higher education, Black women are often not being retained in faculty positions at research universities. There is a gap in the research relative to how Black women experience the tenure process at predominantly White institutions, and this may have important implications for both recruitment and retention of Black women faculty.
   Purpose: This analysis attempts to fill a gap in the literature on the recruitment and retention of faculty of color by asking: What are the experiences of Black women faculty on the tenure track at PWIs who are the only woman of color faculty member in their academic program? Drawing on data from qualitative longitudinal research with Black women faculty who were on the tenure track at PWIs, the primary purpose of this analysis was to understand four Black women's longitudinal reflections on their journey toward tenure at PWIs where they are "othered" by gender and race.
   Setting and Participants: This project was part of a larger study of 22 women faculty who were on tenure-lines in two predominantly White research universities. This study focused on four Black women from this larger study.
   Research Design: This study employed a qualitative longitudinal research design. Data Collection and Analysis: As part of the qualitative longitudinal research design, interviews were conducted each year for five years with each participant.
   Findings: The findings of this analysis with Black women faculty on the tenure-line suggests that despite being the only person of color in their academic programs, they found ways to use their voice in and outside the academy. Finding and using their voices in the academy became a way to push back and resist some of the isolation and racism that the women experienced in the academy, and often the women did so in collectivist spaces with other Black women.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: These findings of this study call into question predominantly White and male spaces in academia and ways that these spaces should be challenged to change. The Black women in this study coped by creating collectivist spaces and finding/using their voices. Rather than focusing on how to encourage Black women to cope and survive in academia, there should be more emphasis on how to change institutional and departmental structures to make these spaces more inclusive and collectivist.

AB Supportive relationships with adults at school are critical to student engagement in adolescence. Additional research is needed to understand how students' racial backgrounds interact with the school context to shape their perceptions of school support. This study employed multilevel, latent variable methods with a sample of Black and White students (N = 19,726, 35.8 % Black, 49.9 % male, mean age = 15.9) in 58 high schools to explore variation in perceived caring, equity, and high expectations by student race, school diversity, and socioeconomic context. The results indicated that Black students perceived less caring and equity relative to White students overall, and that equity and high expectations were lower in diverse schools for both Black and White students. Nonetheless, racial disparities were attenuated in more diverse schools. The findings point to the need for intervention to improve perceptions of school support for Black youth and for all students in lower income and more diverse schools.

TI Black Professors Managing Mentorship: Implications of Applying Social
   Exchange Frameworks to Analyses of Student Interactions and Their
   Influence on Scholarly Productivity

AB Background/Context: Past research has focused on benefits that students reap from mentoring, but less attention has been focused on the faculty experience. Studies on faculty and mentorship tend to highlight the costs that can negatively influence faculty productivity rather than addressing any benefits they may accrue. Black faculty may be at particularly high risk for these challenges, considering their high rates of service and mentorship. By examining the nature of mentoring, this study clarifies how certain types of developmental relationships may distract, but also potentially contribute to the scholarly success of, Black professors.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: The purpose of this study is to explore how Black faculty experience and perceive specific types of interactions within their mentoring relationships, especially in relation to their scholarly productivity. Setting: Data were collected at two large predominantly White research universities of similar size, type, and mission: Oceanside University and Column University (pseudonyms).
   Population/Participants/Subjects: A total of 17 Oceanside professors (10 males, 7 females) and 11 Column professors (6 males, 5 females) agreed to participate. Five participants were assistant, 11 were associate, and 12 were full professors. The largest proportion of faculty taught in the social sciences (n = 12), followed by professional programs (n = 5).
   Research Design: This research is a qualitative multi-case study that uses pattern matching to analyze transcripts of 60- to 90-minute interviews with faculty participants.
   Findings/Results: Interactions with students were perceived as having both costs and benefits, which had varying influence on productivity based on the type of interaction between the faculty member and the student. Collaborative activities (productive exchanges) have the potential to increase faculty productivity; however, interactions that are focused primarily on student development (generalized exchanges) can be rewarding, yet appear more likely to distract from research and limit scholarly productivity.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Although Black professors participating in this study perceived themselves as more likely to counsel students (generalized exchanges), they did not note that they were more likely to collaborate with students, particularly on research. Thus, rather than suggesting that Black faculty have slower rates of advancement and higher rates of attrition because they spend too much time working with students, this study suggests that perhaps their diminished outcomes stem from both frequency and form of interaction. Findings suggest that policy makers and institutional leaders, in addition to supporting Black professors as they work with students, could consider ways to foster the ability of Black professors to simultaneously counsel and collaborate with students as they develop strategies to encourage faculty promotion and retention.

AB Many pre-college programs have been created to try to increase the number of Black professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, few studies have enabled former Black/African American male program participants to share personal narratives on the long-term benefits and burdens from such STEM interventions. We use a critical collaborative autoethnographic approach to highlight our journeys from being STEM summer program participants to becoming college professors in engineering and mathematics. We provide in-depth details about our past participation in Wright State University's former Science, Technology, and Engineering Preparatory Program (Wright STEPP). We discuss people inside and outside of the program who provided us with the community cultural wealth that propelled us into academic STEM roles: family, K-12 teachers, college faculty and staff, and classmates.

AB Historical, socially constructed notions of Black and Latino masculinity, mis/labeled behavior, punitive policies (e.g., suspension) and practices (e.g., school-imposed labeling) lead to disproportionate rates of dropout in urban US schools, continued involvement in the criminal legal system, and a limited participation in society. This article argues that school-imposed labeling-affixing a category or descriptor on a student to signal a shorthand message to others about a student's academic ability and behavior-is symbolically violent (Bourdieu). By examining unofficial labels, punitive structures, and teacher perceptions of labeled students, I explored school-imposed labeling as a form of "normalized" practice that impacts Black and Latino males who attend an urban charter school with a "no excuses" orientation.

TI Toxic Masculinity Masking as Cultural Relevancy: Latino Men Navigating
   Heteropatriarchal Expectations of Manhood in the Teaching Profession

AB In this qualitative study, Michael V. Singh deconstructs how and why Latino men teachers are asked to perform a culturally relevant manhood in the classroom. He looks at the ways these teachers experience and navigate the heteropatriarchal expectations associated with their teaching and gender performance, which are often (mis) framed as "cultural relevancy" and reproduce hegemonic and toxic masculinity. The eleven Latino men in this study described such expectations as coming from teachers and administrators, who positioned them to embody tropes of the macho Mexican patriarch who disciplines unruly boys, and also from students, who sometimes wanted their teachers to perform a Latino manhood admired for its physical and sexual power. The participants also recounted how they navigated these expectations in ways that disrupted and queered the figure of the culturally relevant Latino man teacher. This study deconstructs how and why Latino men teachers are asked to perform a culturally relevant manhood in the classroom.

SO READING & WRITING QUARTERLY

DT Article
ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS; ADOLESCENT READERS; POLICY; MALES; MODEL
AB Parental incarceration, poverty, urban violence, and drug use can be underlying factors of academic achievement gaps between Black urban males and their counterparts. These risk factors have the potential to position low-income urban students as struggling readers. Two qualitative case studies obtained from a larger mixed methods study illustrate exemplary after-school literacy engagements with Black urban adolescent males, each with an incarcerated parent. Two researchers, a counseling psychologist and a teacher educator, collaborated to create a strengths-based after-school program with culturally relevant literacy instruction as their primary objective. The 2 case study findings reveal the complexities of choosing culturally relevant texts, the need for motivation and engagement in order to build skills, and the fact that relationships are essential in the delivery of culturally responsive literacy instruction. The article concludes with recommendations for teachers working with at-risk Black adolescent males that focus on student empowerment, academic success, and building successful futures.

AB The primary objective of this collection is to document the lived experiences of queer teachers of color who work in P-20 education, as a means of identifying and analyzing how the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality impact teaching dispositions and lived struggles. Similar to Anzaldua, Tate, and Valadez and Elsbree call for 'queer border crossings', working across epistemological boundaries and frameworks; the articles presented here cross many disciplinary borders by connecting with individuals across different cultural contexts, in effect breaking pervasive silences of LGB people of color in educational research.

AB Purpose: This article presents a case study of a successful Black male public urban school principal, offering a counterstory to discourses of failure in urban schools. I build on scholars' work in critical caring, the Black principalship, and radical hope to call for an expansion of narrow frameworks of effective school leadership to include an ethic of radical care within urban school leadership. Method: This study represents a counterstory in the tradition of critical race theory, centering the voice and perspectives of a Black male urban school principal. Using ethnographic research methods, this case study was based on prolonged and embedded engagement in the field including observations, informal and formal interviews, and document review. Data were collected and analyzed over a 2-year period. Findings: Five components of effective school leadership emerged from analysis of the data that, taken together, can be described as a radical care framework. These components include the folowing: (a) adopting an antiracist, social just stance; (b) cultivating authentic relationships; (c) believing in students' and teachers' capacity for growth and excellence; (d) strategically navigating the sociopolitical and policy climate; and (e) embracing a spirit of radical hope. Conclusion: In addition to highlighting the power of counterstories in educational leadership research, this study reinforces the critical need for leadership preparation that is grounded in antiracism and social justice, and comprises all aspects of an ethic of radical care. Furthermore, the study points to the need for targeted recruitment of Black and Latinx school leaders, particularly in urban contexts.

AB Social control and procedural justice theories indicate that informal social control reduces problem behaviors. However, many schools have implemented formal control mechanisms such as school security measures. This study examines the association between school security measures (security personnel, metal detectors, and surveillance cameras) and student's perceptions of informal social control (relationships with teachers, other school adults, and the fairness and consistency of school rules). We used structural equation modeling to examine these relationships in a nationally representative sample of 6,547 secondary students surveyed as part of the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (M age = 14.94; 51% male, 60% White non-Hispanic, 14% Black non-Hispanic, 20% Hispanic). The results indicated that the presence of security personnel in schools was associated with poorer student relationships with teachers. Findings for the other school security measures were nonsignificant or inconsistent across models. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB This article reports on research with two Latino male youth workers who express strong criticism of their positioning as "positive" role models for struggling Latino boys in a Latino male mentorship program. Drawing from analytic frameworks attune to the intersectional politics of race and neoliberalism, this article centers the voices of these educators to raise important questions about the neoliberal logics commonly undergirding intervention strategies aimed at boys and young men of color. In particular, these youth workers outline the ways neoliberal notions of respectability and heteropatriarchy become the expected performances for Latino men working with Latino boys. They also describe the ways they resist the positive male role model label to challenge neoliberal definitions of Latino manhood.

AB We explored how teachers perceived challenging behavior in contrast to behaviors that exemplify social-emotional competence, and how descriptions of behavior varied based on child demographics such as gender, race/ethnicity, and disability status. Using a DisCrit lens, we conducted this study under the assumption that perceptions of behavior may be informed by teachers' implicit biases. Fourteen preschool teachers shared their perspectives on behaviors they saw in the classroom, as exemplified by descriptions of the two children they considered the most socially-emotionally successful, A/Z, and the two they considered the most challenging, C/E. Children in the A/Z group were 54% female, 46% male, 54% White, 29% Black, and 82% did not receive special education services or need screening. Children in the C/E group were 86% male, 14% female, 46% Black, 36% White, and 75% were either receiving special education services or identified by teachers as needing a referral for screening. Positive A/Z behaviors included being a model, leader, or helper; having good play skills, manners, and verbal skills; and loving to learn. The challenging behaviors for C/E students included being hard to connect with; engaging in physical aggression and defiance; and having communication difficulties and poor self-regulation skills. These findings help us understand the role of implicit bias, systems issues, and the importance of culturally responsive practices in early childhood settings.

AB This study explores a psychosocial concept coined by the author referred to as "Urban Critical Literacy" (UCL). UCL is an emergent four-step strategy employed by five African American young men as they navigated their cultural worlds of home and school in an urban setting. Critical literacy is the theoretical conceptual framework that underlies this research. Data collected through individual and group interviews and direct observations of home and school are further grounded in constructivist theory to help guide the investigation and documentation of how the participants used UCL. The findings revealed that the participants employed UCL as a strategy to help navigate and negotiate peer pressure, styles of communication, dress, and stereotypes as well as school personnel's unfavorable perceptions of them that can potentially impede their school success. The young men critically identified and reflected on these issues in ways that empowered them to make responsible decisions without jeopardizing their academic goals.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the uncharted territory of disciplinary actions taken against educators for their misconducts. The study examines demographics of the educators who have committed various types of offenses to find out whether results are different than the findings in the criminal justice literature.
   Methods: The data used in this study include all 582 educators who were disciplined for misconduct in the 2012-2013 school year in Texas. Various descriptive and significance tests were used to answer the hypotheses of this study.
   Results: Some of the findings correspond with the findings of the criminal justice literature while others do not. Young, male, and black educators are more likely to offend. Contrary to the literature on "student discipline" and "criminal justice," minority educators are not treated more harshly when they are disciplined. There are some offenses committed more often by younger, male, and those educators who have held their credentials for a shorter amount of time.
   Conclusion: The results have raised many questions similar to the ones studied in the field of criminal justice. A new body of research needs to address questions such as discrimination and the constitutional rights of the accused and the victims.

AB Objective: Develop and test feasibility of a mobile videogame intervention to decrease high-risk sexual behavior in black and Hispanic adolescents. Materials and Methods: Iterative design to develop intervention in partnership with target audience. Feasibility and preliminary impact data collected at baseline, following 2-3 hours of gameplay and at 8-week follow-up. Results: Twenty-six 15-17-year-olds completed pilot testing: 16 (62%) were male, 20 (77%) black or Hispanic. Pilot testing demonstrated feasibility, including producing a usable videogame prototype, incorporating videogame testing within a high school, and participants' acceptability of the videogame. Participants' gameplay experience reflected that most would play the videogame again (77%), stated that they felt responsible for the choices they made in the videogame (73%), and would tell their friends to play the videogame (58%). Most suggested adding more videogame content to further engage participants. From baseline to follow-up, participants demonstrated improvements in condom and contraception self-efficacy (P=0.003), risk perceptions (P=0.009), and high-risk sexual behavior knowledge (P<0.0001). Among black or Hispanic adolescents, we found improvements in summary measures of intentions (P=0.04), self-efficacy (P=0.003), risk perceptions (P=0.002), and sexual knowledge (P=0.0002). Adolescents with previous sexual experience showed similar improvements. Conclusion: Pilot testing of an innovative videogame, developed in partnership with the target audience, demonstrated feasibility and preliminary impact with this cohort of black or Hispanic adolescents. We developed a usable videogame prototype and gained important data about how to enhance the next videogame iteration. Future plans include targeting an older age group to maximize our ability to measure potential impact among sexually experienced adolescents.

TI The Discipline Gap: What's Trust Got to Do With It?
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS; BLACK-AND-WHITE; ACHIEVEMENT GAP;
   EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE; TEACHERS EXPECTATIONS; CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT;
   INTEGRATIVE MODEL; URBAN ELEMENTARY; MIDDLE SCHOOLS; RACE
AB Background/Context: If we are serious about eliminating the racial achievement gap, we need to address the discipline gap as well. The scholarly literature generally paints a positive picture of the potential of trust to transform schools. Research on student trust has shown that students who trust their teachers and schools are suspended and expelled less frequently and have more positive academic outcomes. However; we know little about if or how the impact of trust may vary by race or gender.
   Research Question: Do the benefits of trusting relationships accrue equally to all students? Do trusting student-teacher relationships pay off in less discipline and improved academic outcomes for all students, or do the benefits of trust depend on the race and gender of the student?
   Research Design: Structural equation modeling was used to model the relationships between student trust, behavior, and high school outcomes, controlling for socioeconomic status, school size, and prior achievement. Data, drawn from the Educational Longitudinal Survey of 2002, includes responses from more than 6,000 public high school students (n = 6,352) who identify as African American or White. Comparisons are made between results for White, African American, and African American male students.
   Findings/Results: Student trust is associated with fewer disciplinary incidents and better academic outcomes; however, the benefits of trust do not accrue equally to all students. Black students, particularly males, benefit less from trust. Controlling for trust, behavior, and standardized measures of math and reading ability, Black students are penalized multiple times for a single disciplinary incident: by the suspension (or other consequence), by missed instruction, and by the impact on their grades (and possibly their future course placement and postsecondary plans). In other words, there are unequal consequences of equal discipline.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This research found that Black and White students with roughly equivalent discipline records, scores on achievement tests, and levels of trust still have substantially different high school outcomes. Although efforts to implement restorative justice or positive behavior support programs are a step in the right direction, results suggest that they will not be enough. Schools must deal with implicit bias and the unequal consequences of equal discipline. To do this, we must scrutinize course placement practices, grading, and the messages that we send to students. Failure to do so will continue to leave us with a vast education debt and will continue to fuel the achievement gap.

AB Research suggests that individuals are racially biased when judging the emotions of others (Elfenbein & Ambady, 2002) and particularly regarding attributions about the emotion of anger (Halberstadt. Castro, Chu, Lozada, & Sims, 2018; Hugenberg & Bodenhausen. 2003). Systematic, balanced designs are rare, and are comprised of adults viewing adults. The present study expands the questions of racialized emotion recognition accuracy and anger bias to the world of children. Findings that adults demonstrate either less emotion accuracy and/or greater anger bias for Black versus White children could potentially explain some of the large racialized disciplinary discrepancies in schools. To test whether racialized emotion recognition accuracy and anger bias toward children exists, we asked 178 prospective teachers to complete an emotion recognition task comprised of 72 children's facial expressions depicting six emotions and divided equally by race (Black. White) and gender (female, male). We also assessed implicit bias via the child race Implicit Association Test and explicit bias via questionnaire. Multilevel modeling revealed nuanced racialized emotion recognition accuracy with a race by gender interaction, but clear racialized anger bias toward both Black boys and girls. Both Black boys and Black girls were falsely seen as angry more often than White boys and White girls. Higher levels of either implicit or explicit bias did not increase odds of Black children being victim to anger bias, but instead decreased odds that White children would be misperceived as angry. Implications for addressing preexisting biases in teacher preparation programs and by children and parents are discussed.

AB The Woodlawn Study is an epidemiologically- defined community cohort study of 1242 Black Americans (51% female and 49% male), who were in first grade in 1966-67 in Woodlawn, a neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The study comprises extensive interview data over the life course including self-, mother-, and/or teacher-reported assessments at ages 6, 16, 32, 42, and 62 (in progress), administrative records (i.e., education, crime, and death records), and census data. These data cover a wide range of focal areas across the life course, including family environment, socioeconomic indicators, education, social integration (e.g., marriage, community engagement, religious involvement) and social support, employment, racial discrimination, substance use, crime/victimization, and mental and physical health, including mortality. Over the past 50 years, Woodlawn research has mapped cumulative disadvantage, substance use, and criminal offending and has identified key risk and protective factors of adversity, resilience, and success across the full life course. In turn, these findings have informed life course theory and policy for a population that experiences significant criminal and health disparities.

TI When Ethnic-Racial Discrimination From Math Teachers Spills Over and
   Predicts the Math Adjustment of Nondiscriminated Adolescents: The
   Mediating Role of Math Classroom Climate Perceptions

AB Ethnic-racial discrimination is a pernicious experience that affects discriminated adolescents' healthy human development, but the spillover consequences of discrimination on the nondiscriminated adolescent population are less clear. Adolescents who vicariously witness their classmates experience ethnic-racial discrimination from educators may question their educators' authority and classroom rules, and educators who perpetuate discrimination may engage in other practices that disadvantage the entire classroom. Thus, we posed three research questions: Did classmates' ethnic-racial discrimination from teachers predict adolescents' classroom adjustment outcomes (e.g., class grades, test scores, and engagement), did classroom climate mediate the link between classmates' ethnic-racial discrimination and adolescents' classroom adjustment outcomes, and did the results differ between early versus middle adolescents? To answer these research questions, the present study leveraged longitudinal data among 1,539 adolescents (M-age = 13.81, SDage = 1.49; 60% Black, 30% White, 9% other, 1% Asian; 49% female, 51% male) nested in 104 math classrooms, as math is a subject domain with pervasive ethnic-racial stereotypes about students' abilities and opportunities to succeed in class. Results illustrated that direct and vicarious ethnic-racial discrimination from math educators in the fall semester predicted worse math course grades, state-administered standardized test scores, and classroom engagement across the fall and spring semesters. Math classroom climate perceptions mediated the longitudinal relations between ethnic-racial discrimination and their math adjustment outcomes, and the role of ethnic-racial discrimination varied across different developmental stages of adolescence. Implications for the measurement of ethnic-racial discrimination in the classroom context and the social contagion linked to ethnic-racial disadvantage are discussed.

AB Background/Context: When Ladson-Billings described the pedagogical practices of successful teachers of African American children and consequently conceptualized culturally relevant pedagogy as an analytic resource to describe and make sense of pedagogical practices of teachers, her discussion was situated in a frame that examined instructional moves of teachers, especially with Black students. Since the introduction of this pedagogy, researchers and theorists have broadened Ladson-Billings's conceptualization to include various other factors. However, race is no longer as central as it was when the framework was introduced.
   Purpose/Objective: I examine published literature on culturally relevant pedagogy in mathematics and English language arts that has considered race in some form. The purpose of this synthesis is to highlight patterns across the literature and to consider potential future areas of study to strengthen and encourage focused research on race and CRP.
   Setting: I reviewed established literature to examine the intersections of race, culturally relevant pedagogy, and mathematics or English language arts.
   Research Design: I analyzed research articles in the areas of mathematics and English language arts that examined race in some form between 2004-2014 to determine how race is situated and connected to the core of culturally relevant pedagogy.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Although race was a critical component of Ladson-Billings's conceptualization of culturally relevant pedagogy, research studies in the area demonstrate a marginal, at best, emphasis on race. Studies in the areas of mathematics and English language arts that do include race tend to focus on superficial aspects of race. Future studies should return to the root of the theory and include race as an essential component of empirical studies that draw from culturally relevant pedagogy as an analytic tool to describe pedagogical practices of teachers.

AB Leveraging the Tennessee STAR class size experiment, we show that Black students randomly assigned to at least one Black teacher in grades K-3 are 9 percentage points (13 percent) more likely to graduate from high school and 6 percentage points (19 percent) more likely to enroll in college compared to their Black schoolmates who are not. Black teachers have no significant long-run effects on White students. Postsecondary education results are driven by two-year colleges and concentrated among disadvantaged males. North Carolina administrative data yield similar findings, and analyses of mechanisms suggest role model effects may be one potential channel. (JEL H75, I21, I26, I28, J15)

AB Research has shown that boys display higher levels of childhood conduct problems than girls, and Black children display higher levels than White children, but few studies have tested for scalar equivalence of conduct problems across gender and race. The authors conducted a 2-parameter item response theory (IRT) model to examine item characteristics of the Authority Acceptance scale from the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation-Revised (AA-TOCA-R; L. Larsson-Werthamer, S. G. Kellam, & L. Wheeler, 1991) in 8,820 kindergarten children and estimated the degree of differential item functioning (DIF) by gender and race/urban status. The mean level of latent conduct problems was best represented by behaviors such as being stubborn, breaking rules, and being disobedient, whereas breaking things and taking others' property best represented the construct at one standard deviation above the mean. DIF by gender was detected, such that at equivalent levels of latent conduct problems, males received more endorsements of overt behaviors from teachers, whereas females received more endorsements of nonphysical behaviors. Moreover, overt behaviors were better discriminators of latent conduct problems for males, and nonphysical behaviors were better discriminators of latent conduct problems for females. Differences across race/urban status were not found to be conceptually meaningful. The authors' analyses also suggest that the item scaling of the AA-TOCA-R may be best represented by 5e categories instead of 6. These findings provide support for the use of IRT modeling to examine item characteristics of conduct problem scales and DIF to test for scalar equivalence across diverse subpopulations.

AB Films of the "perestroika" period (1986-1991) related to school/university theme showed that: - the educational / upbringing process has lost the previous strict storylines and in many respects has lost its communist landmarks;
   - both school and university have acute problem areas (crisis, disappointment and fatigue, professional "burning out" of teachers, stagnation, hypocrisy, lies, bureaucracy and authoritarianism, pragmatic cynicism of students, teenage cruelty, underage sexual activity, etc.); - the activity of a schoolchild / student again became more directed toward the outside world than to the inner world;
   - appropriate distance in the teacher-student relationship has become more fragile (familiarity, sexual relation, or its provocation); in the films Work on Mistakes (1988) and Asthenic Syndrome (1989), male teachers even fight with high school students in class or in the school corridor; - the prestige of the pedagogical profession in the eyes of students and the public has fallen even lower; in accordance with the real state of affairs, female teachers' images (often lonely, unsettled) came to the forefront;
   - the main conflicts of plots were built on the opposition of non-ordinary teachers and students with stagnation, bureaucracy, mediocre bosses / colleagues / peers.
   In fact, one can probably assume that the exposing "black series" of the perestroika cinema (where the youth theme was one of the most prominent ones) served a kind of "mobilizing purpose", only at the time it was not the orientation of "Soviet power elites in the renewal of the tools which they embodied the communist project with". Conversely, a Western-oriented part of the Soviet ruling elite used "uncensored" cinematography as one of the levers for the gradual liquidation of socialism. On the other hand, it is possible not to attach special importance to this "conspiracy" assumption, believing that Soviet cinematographers spontaneously walked in the wake of political and socio-cultural changes of the "perestroika" era. After all, we should not forget that by the end of the 1980s a paradoxical situation arose in the USSR when the state continued to finance film production, but in the actual absence of censorship, filmmakers could produce all that they wanted, practically ignoring the opinion of the leading bodies of the CPSU and the government.

AB There is a lack of psychometrically sound tools for measuring youth outcomes in out-of-school time (OST) settings. Consequently, behavior ratings completed by OST staff are being scored as though the raters were teachers, even though cross-informant correlations are notoriously low (meta-analysis r = .27). Across 26 schools, 227 students were assessed by both teachers and OST staff using the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA) to measure Social Emotional Competence. These 4th and 5th grade students were 50% male; 53% 5th graders; and 51% Latino, 20% Mixed/Other, 11% Black, 11% Asian, and 7% White. In the full sample, OST staff rated children's behavior more harshly than teachers (p < .001; d = .32), although the scores were associated (r = .31, p < .001). Among the ratings completed within the same week, teacher and staff distributions were not statistically different. Teacher and staff ratings had a "medium" correlation (r = .42; p = .01) and a classification consistency (88%) that exceeded chance by a "moderate" amount (kappa = .43). Few, if any, studies have previously compared the ratings of the same children by teachers and OST providers. Cross-informant inter-rater reliability between teachers and OST staff was higher than expected on the DESSA.

AB Universal screening for social-emotional and behavioral (SEB) risk is one strategy for schools to proactively identify students in need of additional supports and services. As schools serve an increasing number of children from racially and culturally diverse backgrounds, further research is needed to examine the differential functioning of brief behavior rating scales. The present study examined differential item functioning (DIF) on the Social, Academic, and Emotional Behavior Risk Screener (SAEBRS)-Teacher Rating Scale. Participants included 11,496 kindergartens through 12th-grade students. DIF analyses were conducted by race/ethnicity, grade level, and biological sex. Results indicated small-to-large effects of DIF for teacher ratings of Black students compared to their non-Black peers on each item resulting in a moderate effect at the test level (Total Behavior [TB] expected test score standardized difference [ETSSD] = -0.67). There was a small-to-moderate effect of DIF for teacher ratings of White students compared to their non-White peers at the test level (TB ETSSD = 0.43). There was a small-to-moderate effect of DIF by biological sex, with teachers rating males differentially with high risk (TB ETSSD = -0.47). There were no significant effects at the test level for differences in ratings by grade level. Future research is needed to identify the factors influencing the interaction between the rater, the student, and the rating scale that could lead to resulting differential functioning.

The data arise from a 1-year multicultural feminist critical narrative inquiry. The find, ings demonstrate how the participants' age, ethnicity, class, and spirituality shape music as a spiritual practice. The study details how spiritual people negotiate public schools, conceptualize diverse notions of spirituality, and engage reflection. The article calls for the creation of more equitable policies and practices within schools that value and draw on music as an aspect of spirituality of the students and teachers within.

AB This paper presents the experiences and perceptions of undergraduate computer science and computer engineering students from Minority Serving Institutions with regard to the classes, teachers, academic advisors, and teaching assistants within their programs. It is based on 150 in-depth interviews with female and male students, members of five major ethnic/racial groups (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian). It shows that significant differences exist between female and male students with respect to their perceptions of classes, teachers, and advisors. Both male and female students noted their dissatisfaction with teaching assistants. The paper concludes with suggestions regarding policy directions to improve the situation for female students.

AB The high-poverty urban school building is a prime environment for racial misunderstanding between teenagers and adults: most teachers are white and middle class, while most students are nonwhite and live near the poverty line. In this reflective essay, Jay Wamsted, a white teacher, examines the complicated nature of a teacher-student relationship in one such school. He uses a story of a hallway incident as a frame for examining his time spent teaching a young, black male student, and in doing so he demonstrates both successes and missteps, providing a window into the various interpersonal challenges facing the teacher in the high-poverty urban school.

AB Continuity of pre-k and kindergarten classroom experiences is a key area of interest for early childhood researchers interested in supporting public pre-k children's development over time. To advance the empirical evidence on this topic, this study examined whether differences in classroom experiences as children transition from pre-k to kindergarten are associated with kindergarten social-emotional and self-regulation skills among low-income, race- and language-diverse public pre-k children. Children attending public pre-K were assessed in the spring of pre-k and fall and spring of kindergarten on a range of social-emotional and self-regulation skills (N = 1,358; 67.1 months old (SD = 3.6) in kindergarten; 50% male; 60% Hispanic and/or Latine, 17% Black, 10% White, 13% other). Classroom experiences (teacher-child interactions, teacher-child closeness, and the amount of time spent in teacher-structured activities) were assessed using observations and teacher reports in both grade levels. Regression models adjusted for kindergarten nesting indicated that decreases in teacher-child closeness and the quality of teacher-child interactions were associated with children's lower social competence, learning behaviors, and inhibition in the fall of kindergarten, relative to spring of pre-k. There were limited associations with child gains from fall to spring. Results suggest that differences between pre-k and kindergarten academic and social environments may be difficult for children as they adjust to kindergarten. Findings are discussed in terms of the implications for efforts to align classroom experiences across grades. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A 12-week, 32-lesson afterschool intervention was conducted with third- to fifth-grade urban African American boys classified as aggressive. Grounded in attribution theory and organized around the construct of perceived responsibility in self and others, the intervention focused on increasing both social skills and academic motivation. Participants (N = 64) were randomly assigned to an intervention or no-treatment control group. Boys in the intervention group showed an increase in social skills and academic motivation skills and were rated by their teachers as more cooperative and academically persistent. The implications of the findings for the design of interventions in urban schools are discussed.

AB This article focuses on some languaging that occurred during a race event within a literacy lesson involving a racially White, female adult and a racially Black, male child. I analyze an excerpt from this race event, illustrating an approach to race analysis which might be useful to the field of urban education. I ask, "What is the racial significance of this teacher's language during literacy instruction?" In other words, I am pursuing what a practice theory of race might allow us to know when this alternative account of race is used to examine an observed episode of teaching. Accordingly, I introduce practice of race theory (PRT) and report my race critical discourse analysis of one teacher's observed instructional language. Findings are relevant to literacy instruction, and future literacy research is recommended, especially in urban education.

AB Our knowledge of factors that predict suicide attempts among high school students of different gender/race/ethnic categories is still limited. Methods: This research examines how factors such as binge drinking and being forced to have sex impact attempted suicide among high school students in the U.S. during 1991-2013. Results: The average age of the students was 16.2 and there were 773 Native American females, 20,696 Hispanic females. 3,005 Asian females, 17,847 Black females, 33,027 White females, 915 Native American males, 19,374 Hispanic males, 3,122 Asian males, 15,044 Black males, and 33,377 White males. Regression and difference of means analyses find that factors such as that binge drinking and being forced to have sex, as well as a combination of factors, significantly increase the risk of attempting suicide. Discussion: Results of this research may benefit teachers, school nurses, high school counselors, and peer-support groups as they counsel with high school students who may be suicidal.

SO ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW

AB Black and Hispanic high school students enroll in Advanced Placement (AP) courses at approximately half the rate of white students. This paper develops a microeconomic model of the AP participation decision and finds that low income is the single most important factor behind the minority AP participation gap. In addition, minority students enroll in AP math, science, and English at lower rates than comparable white students. Magnet schools promote AP participation among white students but reduce participation among college-bound black students. Race-matched role models promote AP-taking among high-achieving black males, and AP incentive programs have the potential to dramatically increase minority student participation. Policy implications include reducing the impersonal nature of large high schools by creating smaller "schools-within-a-school" while maintaining flexibility across academic tracks, eliminating magnet programs, hiring qualified AP teachers to actively mentor minority students, and implementing incentive programs that promote teacher training and provide incentives for student achievement.

TI Patterns and Factors of High School Dropout Risks of Racial and

SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS PLACED AT RISK

AB This study examined the dropout trajectories of racial and linguistic minority students and explored the effects of students' contextual factors on their high school dropout risks. Our motivation was to identify the dropout patterns of Black, Hispanic, and Hispanic English language learner (ELL) students, who have comparatively high dropout rates, and to suggest ways to promote high school completion. We employed a survival analysis using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The results showed that the 3 minority groups displayed significantly higher dropout risks than the White group. The overall pattern of dropout risks increased over time, with the dropout rates of the Black students high in the 1st and 2nd years of high school and the highest dropout rates for Hispanic ELL students in their senior year. A gender difference was found among the students, with male students having higher dropout risks than female students. It was also found that students' positive relationships with their teachers were associated with lower dropout risks.

TI "It's not a deaf thing, it's not a black thing; it's a deaf black

   identities

AB Deaf students are under-enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors, making it important to explore how and why deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students connect (or fail to connect) with STEM. Engaging students in informal STEM with attention to how such experiences interact with their identities has the potential for broad impact on supporting DHH adolescents' entry into STEM areas of postsecondary study and later into STEM careers. We explored the intersectionality of DHH minority racial/ethnic high school students' identities and how it relates to their connection to STEM during a summer program and throughout the following school year. We report on three case studies, followed by a cross-case analysis. Participants were DHH high school students from underrepresented minority racial/ethnic groups. Our case studies were of one female and two male students. Data sources included a battery of surveys assessing scientific sensemaking, affinity toward STEM, and reading ability, as well as a focus group during summer STEM camp, individual interviews the following school year, and observations of photographs taken during camp by volunteers working at the camp. We pinpoint instances of connection to and disconnection from STEM in our three cases. Cross-case analysis implicates a need for applied learning opportunities that overcome language-related barriers for American Sign Language (ASL) users. They also suggest a role for STEM-relevant mentorship that is sensitive to adolescents' intersectional identities, particularly employing adult mentors with whom adolescents can identify. Finally, findings suggest that adolescents are attempting to connect STEM with their everyday lives, particularly their career aspirations. Importantly, our three cases were better able to apply STEM to the real world and career goals in an informal summer STEM camp than in their formal science, math, and engineering classrooms. We discuss implications for curriculum, instruction, and teacher preparation.

AB Improving school climate is important to reducing disparities in exclusionary discipline, yet the relationship between school climate and school discipline remains poorly understood. Although prior studies have largely relied on students' perceptions to measure school climate, few studies have examined how school contextual factors such as prior disciplinary history or school personnel may affect students' perception of school climate. In the present study, we used student responses from the annually administered New York City School Survey to examine the relationship between student perception of school climate and school personnel, drawing on a longitudinal student-level sample for public middle and high schools for the years 2011-2012 through 2018-2019 (N N = 3,988,020 student-years). Using linear regression analyses to predict student perceptions of school climate, we found that various student and school characteristics had small but statistically significant associations with student perceptions (all effect sizes <0.1). Black male students and Black students receiving special education services were most likely to have negative perceptions of school climate. Students' perceptions of school climate were shaped more by teachers than school leaders. Teacher experience was associated with more positive student perceptions, whereas teacher and school leader turnover were associated with worse perceptions of school climate. School personnel diversity (i.e., the percentage of teachers, principals, or assistant principals who were Black or Latinx) was negatively associated with students' perceptions of school climate, although there was evidence of a positive association between school personnel diversity and school climate specifically for Black and Latinx students. The study adds to calls for investments in school personnel to improve school climate to reduce racial inequality in exclusionary discipline.

AB Students' social competence was investigated in relation to race/ethnicity and gender for a sample of 371 Zimbabwean students attending racially/ethnically integrated schools. About 42% of the students were black, and 58% white (mean age 12 years; SD =9 months). Peer and teacher sociometric ratings of children's social behaviour, social responsibility, and friendliness comprised the social competence measures. Tests of empirical independence among these social competence measures supported their uniqueness in reliably assessing components of the general construct of social competence among Zimbabwean students. Multiple analysis of variance procedures were used to examine the relationship between social competence statuses and group membership (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender) while controlling for aggregate scores and classroom racial proportions. Superior academic achievement and racial/ehnic propinquity are social status levelling factors in multiracial school settings. Teachers rated white students higher on social responsibility and social behaviour. Students rated white students higher on social responsibility only. Comparisons of social competence by ethnicity and gender revealed that white and female students were rated significantly higher on social behaviour and social responsibility than their black and male classmates. Female students were perceived as more socially competent or better adjusted to school than males. Reliable differences in social competence in race/ethnicity and gender groups were concentrated in peer ratings of social responsibility and in teacher ratings of social behaviour and social responsibility. In postcolonial settings or settings with a history of race/ethnicity and gender-based privilege, minorities from a dominant culture may have higher social status than peers from a majority culture. Superior social competence in females is a resource for school adaptation and social climate. Students have perceptions of social competence in peers that only partially overlap with those of teachers and contribute uniquely to their experience of school. Social competence in students is multifaceted, gendered, and differently perceived by teachers and peers.

AB In this article, I propose Critical Race English Education (CREE) as a theoretical and pedagogical construct that tackles white supremacy and anti-black racism within English education and ELA classrooms. I employ autoethnography and counterstorytelling as methods that center my multiple identities and lived realities as I document my racialized and gendered experiences in relation to my journey to Ferguson, MO and my experiences as a secondary ELA teacher. The research questions guiding this study are the following: (I) As a Black male English educator and language and literacy scholar, how am I implicated in the struggle for racial justice and what does it mean for me to teach literacy in our present-day justice movement?; (2) How are Black lives mattering in ELA classrooms?; and, (3) How are we using Black youth life histories and experiences to inform our mindset, curriculum, and pedagogical practices in the classroom? This article explicates findings from three interconnected stories that work to show how CREE can be operationalized to better understand the #BlackLivesMatter movement in its historical and contemporary dimensions. The data analyzed stem from my autobiographical narratives, observations, social media artifacts, and images. I aim to expand English education to be more synergistically attuned to racial justice issues dealing with police brutality, the mass incarceration of Black people, and legacies of grassroots activism. This analysis suggests implications that aim to move the pedagogical practices around the intersections of anti-blackness and literacy from the margins to the center of discussion and praxis in ELA contexts.

AB This paper presents the experiences of a racially integrated research team - two Black male scholars and one white female scholar - drawn from a series of recorded conversations and journal entries as part of weekly research meetings while engaging in race research across more than a year's time. While our work inherently centered race by nature of the topics we researched, we chose to also critically reflect on what it means to do research together as Black and white scholars, and how kinesiology might benefit from our model of working together. Through thoughtful reflection linked to scholarship, we aimed to answer the questions of how our work yielded new understandings of the data we were collecting and analyzing, and how the field might utilize our collective research team experience. Using Critical Race Theory, Critical Whiteness Studies, and intersectionality, we situated our experiences of working together within the existing literature on race dynamics in higher education to illustrate how our processes disrupted whiteness and furthered a justice-oriented approach to conducting race research. First, we highlight the status of race in higher education and kinesiology, with a specific focus on PE teacher education (PETE), since that is our field of study. From there, we outline the theoretical frameworks that informed the research project and our approach to working together. Next, we use the meeting recordings and transcriptions to analyze how the research team functioned, highlighting Korey Boyd's and Cory Dixon's experiences of engaging in race-related research and then turning to Mara Simon's reflexive attempts to disrupt whiteness even as she embodied it within the group dynamics. Finally, we conclude by addressing negotiations and tensions of this process, along with implications and recommendations for future race research in kinesiology.

AB The decisions to attend college are analysed and nonparametric predictions compared to those obtained from the widely used logit model. The impacts of measured cognitive ability and proxies for high school quality on the decisions to attend college are examined for a sample of white and black males and females from the USA. Two different parameters of interest which isolate the effects of ability and high school quality on college entry decisions are described and estimated by 'integrating out' the effect of other covariates. It is found that measured cognitive ability is an extremely important determinant of college entry for all race and gender groups. At the same point in the ability distribution, blacks are more likely to select into college than whites, and females more likely than males of the same racial group. Proxies for high school quality such as teacher education, student teacher ratios, school enrolment and library size are shown to have little or no effects on the likelihood of college entry for all race and gender groups. Further, predictions obtained from the flexible nonparametric analysis are found to be quite similar to those obtained from the logit model, suggesting that simpler fully parametric binary choice models perform quite well as modelling college entry decisions.

AB This study investigated African American students to determine effective ways to channel their energy in the mathematics classroom. Two African American male students participated in this qualitative inquiry that allowed them to speak for themselves about the characteristics of teachers and instructional practices that can contribute, in general, to students' and, in particular, to African American students' success in the mathematics classroom. The voices of these two African American mathematics students will also offer some suggestions to teachers for channeling the energy of students in general and African American males in particular.

TI Creating spaces for emotional justice in culturally sustaining literacy
   education: Implications for policy & practice
SO THEORY INTO PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID READER-RESPONSE; STORIES
AB Drawing from theories of culturally sustaining literacy practices, Black and Latinx Crit, and feminist theories, the authors explore emotional justice as a form of critical social emotional learning to counter the race-neutral emphasis of social and emotional learning focused on universal characteristics and academic aims. They argue that centering the lived experiences of Black and Brown students helps nurture critically conscious subjectivities and opportunities for authentic literacy engagements including students' reader response, linguistic freedom, and play, among other culturally situated forms of literacy. Their analysis of a Black male student's literacy experiences and extant language and literacy research centering cultural sovereignty and racial resistance, highlights the role of teachers and school policies as forces that can diminish or exacerbate the well-being of Black and Brown children in schools. The article concludes with recommendations and suggestions for fostering culturally sustaining literacy practices that are emotionally just.

AB Objective To evaluate the benefits of the Fast Track Friendship Group program implemented as a stand-alone school-based intervention on the social cognitions, social behavior, peer and teacher relationships of peer-rejected students. Method Over four successive years, 224 peer-rejected elementary students (57% White, 17% Black, 20% Latinx, 5% multiracial; 68% male; grades 1-4; M-age = 8.1 years old) were identified using peer sociometric nominations and randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 110) or a treatment-as-usual control group (n = 114). Four school districts serving economically-disadvantaged urban and rural communities participated. Intervention involved weekly small group social skills training with classmate partners, with sessions tailored to address individual child needs. Consultation meetings held at the start and mid-point of intervention were designed to help teachers and parents support the generalization of targeted skills. Results Multi-level linear models, with children nested within schools (controlling for demographics and baseline scores) documented improvements in social-cognitive skills (direct assessments of emotion recognition and competent social problem-solving), social behavior (teacher ratings of social skills and externalizing behavior), and interpersonal relationships (peer sociometric nominations of peer acceptance and friendships, teacher-rated student-teacher closeness). Significant effects were generally small (ds = .19-.36) but consistent across child sex, grade level, and behavioral characteristics. Conclusions The intervention proved feasible for high-fidelity implementation in school settings and produced significant improvements in the social adjustment of peer-rejected children, validating the approach as a school-based Tier 2 intervention.

AB PurposeThis study contributes to the science of teaching reading and vocabulary by illustrating how a ubiquitous classroom practice - read alouds - can be enhanced by structured supplements. This experimental study examines whether and to what extent providing structured supplements can improve student comprehension outcomes by helping teachers foster discussions about academic vocabulary that support schema transfer as students make connections between known and new topics.MethodA total of 80 third-grade teachers and their students (N = 965; 32% Black, 31% Hispanic, 25% white, 9 Asian, 48% Male) were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. Treatment students received a single social studies read aloud on the story of Apollo 11 with structured supplements while control students received the same read aloud story but without structured supplements. Students were from linguistically, economically, and ethnically diverse backgrounds.ResultsEffect sizes from hierarchical linear models indicated that students in the treatment condition outperformed students in the control condition on four measures of domain-specific reading comprehension: recall (ES = .17), near-transfer (ES = .17), mid-transfer (ES = .18), and content comprehension (ES = .18). Further exploratory analyses using structural equation modeling revealed that teacher language scaffolds - that is, temporary dialogic supports in which teachers went above and beyond the intervention script - explained 66% of the treatment effect on domain-specific reading comprehension.ConclusionResults from this study suggest that read alouds, when enhanced with structured supplements designed to facilitate schema transfer, can increase the amount of academic vocabulary teachers use during classroom instruction and improve their students' ability to comprehend disciplinary texts.

AB Background. Early education interventions have been forwarded as a means for reducing social disparities in income and health in adulthood. We explore whether a successful early education intervention, which occurred between 1985 and 1989, improved the employment rates, earnings and health of blacks relative to whites through 2008. Methods. We used data from Project STAR (Student Teacher Achievement Ratio), a four-year multi-center randomized controlled trial of reduced class sizes in Tennessee involving 11,601 students. Students were initially randomized within 79 schools to classes with 22-25 or 13-17 students. We linked subject records to Social Security Administration (SSA) earnings and disability data collected between 1997 and 2008-when the majority of subjects were between the ages of 18 and 28. We focused our analysis on annual, rather than cumulative, measures of earnings and employment because educational attainment after high school might reduce earnings through age 23. We considered three or more years of statistically significant positive (or negative) annual impacts to be a meaningful effect. Results. Project STAR improved cognition and high school graduation rates. These benefits were primarily realized among low-income and minority students. These early education benefits did not translate into reduced disability claims in adulthood for treated subjects. However, exposure to small class size increased employment for blacks, and increased earnings for black males (p<0.05). Exposure to small classes also led to an increase in earnings for white males. However, white females exposed to small classes experienced a net decline in earnings and employment across the later years of follow up (p<0.05), offsetting any gains by white males. Conclusions. Exposure to small class size in grades K-3 appears to improve earnings and employment for black males and earnings for white males, while reducing employment and earnings among white females.

AB The authors propose critical breaching experiments as a means to destabilize and render inoperative the white, male, colonialist gaze. We begin with an overview of breakdowns in phenomenological and critical phenomenological literatures and how this can be articulated within the breaching experiment model composed of four dimensions including collective and sustained breakdowns, hesitant looking practices, critiques of how bodies hold onto sedimented habits of seeing, and a subsequent new mode of seeing embodying an ethic of adjacency. We then discuss three critical breaching experiments conducted in our preservice art teacher education courses, highlighting the effects (positive and negative) on students.

AB The reading trajectory of African Americans males within the PreK-12 special education system has been at the forefront of scholarship. This case study was to understand how Zion's misidentification may have influenced his reading experiences. The inequalities Zion encountered in Special Education are examined through the Critical Race Theory and DisCrit lens. The article is illuminating the racialized impact of special education practices and policies, analyzed through Zion's experiences of receiving services for an emotional/behavioral disability identification rather than receiving specific reading services and accommodations.

AB Background/Context: While an abundance of evidence demonstrates how unequal conditions in schools contribute to unequal learning outcomes, the extent to which students' affective experiences of schooling reflect similar incongruences warrants further inquiry. Framing this discussion are empirical accounts and popular narratives of schools as socializing institutions that ascribe particular gendered, racialized, and otherwise socially defined identities to young people. These intersections form the basis of their experiences as students and likely shape their individual happiness in schools.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article examines, from an intersectional perspective, whether there are group differences in self-reported happiness in school. Our findings challenge the broad argument that girls are happier in schools because this pattern only holds when comparing levels of happiness between White girls and boys.
   Research Design: Using data from the Measures of Effective Teaching (MET) study, we provide descriptive averages of levels of happiness by sex and race/ethnicity. Given that these patterns are likely shaped by classroom (and teacher and school) conditions, we next use classroom fixed effects models that predict levels of happiness. This modeling strategy makes comparisons only among students in the same classroom who are taught by the same teacher and housed in the same school.
   Findings/Results: We found that the argument that girls are happier than boys in schools only applies to White students. In contrast, there are no gender differences among Latinx and Asian American students, and we found that Black girls are less happy than their male counterparts.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Overall, our article's findings challenge widespread notions that there are universal gender differences in happiness in schools. More broadly speaking, our work speaks to the socializing function of schools and indicates that the gendering process cannot be interpreted without an analysis of how schools also construct race and ethnicity. Future work can build from our study to examine whether the patterns revealed in this study hold true in older grades, given that one of our secondary findings is that older students seem less happy in schools than their younger peers. Research should also examine how interactions with key social actors, such as peers and teachers, shape student happiness in school.

AB Using data from a randomized experiment and fixed effect quantile regression (FEQR), we examine the effects of having a TFA teacher on test scores across the entire achievement distribution of primary school students in disadvantaged neighborhoods. While we generally find that TFA teachers neither help nor hurt students in terms of reading test scores, we find positive and statistically significant effects of TFA across the math achievement distribution for the full sample and the effects are fairly uniform. We find a similar distributional effect of TFA within student gender, although the FEQR estimates for female students are two to three times larger than for male students. We also find that there is evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of TFA for Hispanic and black students and for students taught by novice teachers. Finally, we find that the effect of TFA is homogeneous across the math achievement distribution irrespective of certification type. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, the authors discuss the potential for emancipatory pedagogies, which include practices like the use of digital tools and popular culture, to undo deficit constructions of Black and Latino males and their literacy practices. They discuss why such practices are not more readily available and visible in traditional urban school settings but how their use of digital tools and popular culture with urban Black and Latino males happens in alternative settings and outside official school contexts. The authors challenge the criminalization and policing of digital and popular literacies among Black and Latino males in urban school settings and reflect on the ways that they have witnessed emancipation and empowerment when these male students were not only allowed but free to engage in such practices.

AB This paper describes the evaluation of one year of infant/early childhood mental health consultation (IECMHC) in subsidized early care and education settings provided by the New York City Early Childhood Mental Health Network. The evaluation examined direct and indirect outcomes of IECMHC including (1) improved classroom practices by ECE teachers, and (2) improved social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes among children in the classroom. The study also reviewed child attributes that might have moderated outcomes. An analysis using paired t-tests of pre-and post-assessment data found significant improvements over time in the classroom environment and management practices, as well as in teachers' perceptions of the degree of difficulty presented by children's classroom behaviors. There were significant improvements in protective factors and problem behaviors among the subset of 138 children who received assessments. Improvements were greater for Black/African American children and for all children with pre-assessment scores in the concern range. Males showed greater improvement in protective factors whereas females showed greater improvement in behavioral concerns. IECMHC is a powerful intervention to improve teachers' classroom management and their perceptions of children's behavior and is important in the context of biases that place marginalized groups at risk of punitive actions by teachers and administrators.

AB The present study investigated the differential predictive validity of the Initial Skills Analysis. In the fall, these reading screening tests were administered to students in Grades K to 3. In the spring, a series of reading outcomes tests were administered to these same students, and teachers provided judgments of the students' reading skills. For the male-female, Hispanic/non-Hispanic, and Black/non-Black comparisons, the hierarchical regression models showed that if a single prediction model was used, the screening tests overpredicted minority performance at several grade levels. However, no consistent evidence of differential prediction with practical importance was found for any of the groups studied. Although the results were consistent with past research, overprediction of the criterion scores by a screening test could result in minority students not receiving needed remediation services. As a result, further evidence for the validity of these screening tests should continue to be collected.

AB Multi-informant report of student emotional and behavioral problems determines eligibility for school-based services; however, multiple informants often yield inconsistent reports of child concerns. Informant discrepancies are thought to reflect either measurement error or meaningful differences (e.g., situational variation). It is important to understand the source of inconsistencies because informant discrepancy may influence treatment outcome. The current study assessed whether informant discrepancies of internalizing and externalizing symptoms reflect meaningful differences between informants. Parents, teachers, and children (N = 169; M age = 10.32; 65.1% Black, 30.8% Latino/Hispanic; 66.9% Male) completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd Edition (BASC-2). The Operations Triad Model (OTM) guided the data analysis plan to identify the source of informant discrepancy. We predicted that informant discrepancy would reflect meaningful differences, as opposed to measurement error. Parent-teacher reports of hyperactivity, aggression, and anxiety, as well as teacher-child reports of anxiety and hyperactivity, supported the notion that informant discrepancies of internalizing and externalizing symptoms reflected meaningful differences. Implications of these discrepancies for interpretation of results in school-based assessment of emotional and behavioral disorders are discussed.

AB This longitudinal study explores three research questions. First, what is the prevalence of math and science gender stereotypes among high school students, their parents, and teachers? Second, are parents' and teachers' gender stereotypes related to adolescents' stereotypes? And third, are adolescents' gender stereotypes associated with their math and science identity and outcomes? We used a nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 22,190, 50% girls, 53% White, 22% Latinx, 13% Black) of adolescents surveyed at 9th and 11th grade, their parents, and teachers. Adolescents' transcripts were also collected at the end of high school. Adolescent gender stereotypes became significantly more traditional from 9 to 11th grade. Parents were three times more likely to believe that males are better at math/science (compared to believing females are better), and we found significant positive relations between parents' and adolescents' stereotypes. Finally, adolescents' math/science gender stereotypes were significantly related to their math/science identity, which in turn was related to their STEM outcomes over the course of high school. Our findings give insight to the development of academic gender stereotypes in adolescence, their potential precursors, and their relations to academic outcomes.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine how the social practices of African American families-with children in grades K-2-changed as a result of participating in a family literacy program utilizing African American children's literature. The families were exposed, through a series of workshops, to an abundance of children's literature written by and about African Americans. Data sources included pre and post interviews conducted with parents, parental reading logs, and a reflective journal kept by the researcher. Findings suggested that parents increased the amount of time reading aloud to their children, passed along the information that they learned about African American children's literature to family, friends, and co-workers, and began seeking out and developing an appreciation for quality African American children's literature. This study was unique in that it involved collaboration between a public university, a local church, an African American sorority, and an innovative teacher recruitment initiative designed to increase the number of Black, male elementary school teachers.

AB We estimate returns to school resources in the Jim Crow era, as measured by young males' 1940 wage earnings, occupational status, and cognitive aptitude scores. Results point to a 16 cent annual return on each $1 invested in public schools. To the question of whether some school inputs mattered more than others, we find comparable 25-32 cent returns per dollar invested in extended school years, teacher salaries, and smaller classes. School spending and inputs had much more bearing on labor market outcomes than aptitude scores. We document diminishing returns to school expenditures, which, in combination with segregated schools, resulted in higher returns to expenditures in black schools relative to white.

   STUDENT; DISPROPORTIONALITY; PUNISHMENT; EXCLUSION; BEHAVIOR
AB In this article, I use ethnographic data to theorize about the causes of Black-White racial disparities in discipline at a "mostly White" middle school. Using critical race and institutional theories, I identify two racial discipline logics: criminalized sequestering and racial exemption. These logics differently governed how school leaders and teachers administered discipline among Black and White students and created a dual system that generated disparate outcomes. Overall, my analysis aids in understanding the organizational processes that produce Black-White racial discipline disparities, introduces new theoretical concepts for future research, and brings to the fore largely unexamined punitive, in-school discipline practices.

AB OBJECTIVE. The goal was to evaluate whether children of incarcerated fathers are more likely to report or exhibit behavioral symptoms than their equally disadvantaged peers without an incarcerated father.
   METHODS. During an ongoing longitudinal study of intrauterine cocaine exposure involving 102 children ( 50% male and 89% black) from urban, low- income homes, questions regarding incarceration of the child's father were asked of the child's primary caregiver at each visit during school age. Children were administered the Children's Depression Inventory between the ages of 6 and 11 years, and their primary caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist. In addition, the children's teachers completed the Teacher Report Form. Children's Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist, and Teacher Report Form data obtained at the oldest available age after the first report of paternal incarceration were analyzed.
   RESULTS. In bivariate analyses, children whose fathers were in jail had higher Children's Depression Inventory total scores compared with children without incarcerated fathers, indicating more depressive symptoms. This finding was robust in multivariate analyses after adjustment for children's age, gender, prenatal cocaine and alcohol exposure, and school- age violence exposure. Teachers reported higher Teacher Report Form externalizing scores for children whose fathers were in jail, after adjustment for age, gender, prenatal cocaine and marijuana exposure, and school- age violence exposure.
   CONCLUSIONS. Children of incarcerated fathers reported more depressive symptoms and their teachers noted more externalizing behaviors, after controlling for other biopsychosocial risks. Interventions targeted to ameliorate the distress of children with incarcerated fathers should be considered.

AB A number of studies have used variable-centered approaches to examine informant discrepancies on children's behavior problems; however, few such studies have used person-centered approaches to explore patterns of informant discrepancies or correlates of discrepancies in informant symptom ratings. The present study addressed these gaps by examining profiles of informant agreement on internalizing and externalizing symptoms and examining whether two important contextual factors, parenting and school engagement, are associated with profile membership. Data from an at-risk, urban sample of youth participants (N= 346, M age = 12.47 +/- 0.60 years, 56% male, and 75% Black), their caregivers, and one of their teachers were analyzed in the current study. Youth from 20 schools in a Mid-Atlantic state were screened for elevated levels of aggression and were selected to participate in the Early Adolescent Coping Power study. At baseline, youth, caregivers, and teachers reported on youth's internalizing symptoms and caregivers and teachers reported on youth's externalizing symptoms. Caregivers reported on their parenting; youth reported on their school engagement. Two internalizing symptoms profiles were identified: Low Symptoms Agreement and Youth-Reported High Somatization and Anxiety. Three externalizing symptoms profiles were identified: Low Symptoms Agreement, Teacher-Reported High Externalizing, and Caregiver-Reported High Externalizing. These profiles differed significantly on parenting behaviors and school engagement, shedding light on factors that may underlie informant discrepancies.

AB Developmental research suggests that peer rejection has negative spillover effects which strain parent-child relationships and parent attitudes toward the child's school. This study tested whether a school-based social skill training program could reverse these effects and improve parent-child closeness and parent attitudes toward the school. Participants included 217 children who were rejected by peers (57% White, 17% Black, 20% Latinx, 5% multiracial; 68% male; Mage = 8.1 years old) identified with sociometric social preference scores and randomized to intervention or control groups. Parents rated parent-child closeness and parent attitudes toward school at the start and end of the intervention year. Multilevel path analyses indicated that intervention improved parent-child closeness and, for children in the older grade levels only, enhanced parent attitudes toward the school. Additional analyses revealed that intervention effects on parent-child closeness were direct whereas effects on attitudes toward school were mediated by intervention-related increases in teacher support and peer liking. Implications for intervention design and future research are discussed.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the ways in which hip-hop pedagogies and literacies encouraged middle school students to explore performance poetry as a tool to "(w) right" the truth(s) about learning and living in their local and global communities.
   Design/methodology/approach - Collaborative self-study research methodologies were used by the author, a black male teacher educator and hip-hop cultural insider, along with two white, female reading specialists and hip-hop cultural outsiders, to collect and analyze the practices and behaviors used in The Shop - an after-school hip-hop-based spoken word poetry club for middle school students in a small, urban public school district in Northeastern USA.
   Findings - Three primary findings emerge: teachers with limited cultural and content knowledge of hip-hop may struggle to negotiate real and perceived curricular constraints associated with using pedagogies with hip-hop texts and aesthetics in traditional school contexts, the intersections of teachers' racial, cultural and gender identities informed the respective practices and behaviors in a number of interesting ways, and using hip-hop pedagogies for social justice in public schools requires a delicate balance of both transparency and discretion on the part of teachers.
   Originality/value - Study findings are salient for in-and pre-service English teachers and English educators, as they offer insights and reflections on the instructional and relational challenges cultural outsiders may face when using hip-hop culture to create spaces and opportunities for young people to talk back and speak truth to power.

AB This study tested the relative efficacy of two interventions for children referred for consultation services due to problem behavior in the classroom. Teachers nominated children for participation due to frequent disruptive behaviors, such as inappropriate vocalizations and off-task behavior. Four Black males from 3 to 4 years old who attended Head Start centers served as the participants. Each child received a functional assessment that included a teacher-completed functional assessment rating scale and a brief functional analysis. Following functional assessments, an alternating treatments design was used to test the relative efficacy of an intervention matched to function and the Mystery Motivator intervention, not matched to function. Results indicate that both the intervention matched to function and the Mystery Motivator intervention were superior to a no-intervention control condition, but the function-matched intervention was more effective than the Mystery Motivator intervention for reducing problem behaviors and increasing appropriate engagement for all four children. Results are discussed in terms of learning principles potentially responsible for differential efficacy, as well as implications for applied practice.

AB This study evaluated the Problem Behavior Frequency Scale (PBFS), a self-report measure designed to assess adolescents' frequency of victimization, aggression, and other problem behaviors. Analyses were conducted on a sample of 5,532 adolescents from 37 schools at 4 sites. About half (49%) of participants were male; 48% self-identified as Black non-Hispanic; 21% as Hispanic, 18% as White non-Hispanic. Adolescents completed the PBFS and measures of beliefs and values related to aggression, and delinquent peer associations at the start of the 6th grade and over 2 years later. Ratings of participants' behavior were also obtained from teachers on the Behavioral Assessment System for Children. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a 7-factor model that differentiated among 3 forms of aggression (physical, verbal, and relational), 2 forms of victimization (overt and relational), drug use, and other delinquent behavior. Support was found for strong measurement invariance across gender, sites, and time. The PBFS factors generally showed the expected pattern of correlations with teacher ratings of adolescents' behavior and self-report measures of relevant constructs.

AB In this article, we use administrative data from three cohorts of North Carolina public high school students to examine the effects of within-school segregation on the propensity of academically eligible black high school students to take advanced math courses. Our identification strategy takes advantage of cohort-to-cohort variation in the share of eleventh and twelfth grade black students enrolled in advanced math courses when a cohort first enters a school in the ninth grade. We find that a 1 point increase in the percentage of black eleventh and twelfth graders in advanced math courses increases the likelihood that an academically eligible black student will take an advanced math course before they graduate by 22 percentage points in racially diverse schools. Effects are larger for black males.

AB We study the results of a massive nationwide correspondence experiment sending more than 83,000 fictitious applications with randomized characteristics to geographically dispersed jobs posted by 108 of the largest U.S. employers. Distinctively Black names reduce the probability of employer contact by 2.1 percentage points relative to distinctively white names. The magnitude of this racial gap in contact rates differs substantially across firms, exhibiting a between-company standard deviation of 1.9 percentage points. Despite an insignificant average gap in contact rates between male and female applicants, we find a between-company standard deviation in gender contact gaps of 2.7 percentage points, revealing that some firms favor male applicants and others favor women. Company-specific racial contact gaps are temporally and spatially persistent, and negatively correlated with firm profitability, federal contractor status, and a measure of recruiting centralization. Discrimination exhibits little geographical dispersion, but two-digit industry explains roughly half of the cross-firm variation in both racial and gender contact gaps. Contact gaps are highly concentrated in particular companies, with firms in the top quintile of racial discrimination responsible for nearly half of lost contacts to Black applicants in the experiment. Controlling false discovery rates to the 5% level, 23 companies are found to discriminate against Black applicants. Our findings establish that discrimination against distinctively Black names is concentrated among a select set of large employers, many of which can be identified with high confidence using large-scale inference methods.

AB Culturally responsive pedagogy in music education is becoming increasingly crucial for all students, in all types of music programs, and at all levels of education as demographic shifts occur in schools. In music ensembles, the selection of repertoire is a critical component of culturally responsive pedagogy. The purpose of this study was to investigate student perceptions of repertoire in college music ensembles. This study was guided by the following research questions: (a) Do students perceive current ensemble repertoire as representative and supportive of their self-identities? (b) What are these perceptions according to students' race or ethnicity, gender, and ensemble type? (c) What factors do students consider important in directors' selection of repertoire? (d) How are directors' current repertoire selection practices, as experienced by the respondents, informed by or responsive to gender and racial diversity in the ensembles? Respondents (N=278) were graduate and undergraduate college students enrolled in band, choir, or orchestra. Data were collected through an online questionnaire. Overall, respondents felt that current repertoire practices were representative and supportive, although male respondents rated composer gender as lower in importance in repertoire selection than both females and those not identifying as male or female. White students indicated that they felt repertoire selection was more representative of their gender than Black, Indigenous, and other students of color. Respondents also indicated a desire for more underrepresented composers in ensemble repertoire. Numerous implications are provided, including the need for an increased focus on culturally responsive repertoire selection processes in teacher preparation programs.

AB From conception to death, helping relationships promote positive development and enable people to surmount challenges in their lives. Is it the case that the negative consequences of a genetic propensity for risky behaviors can be attenuated by helping relationships (a G x E)? But is it also the case that people with such a genetic propensity are less likely to have helping relationships compared to people without such a propensity (a rGE)? We illustrate this complex pattern of gene-environment interplay by drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and a combinatoric analytic strategy. We focus on a gene associated with dopamine receptor type 2 (DRD2 TaqIA), student-mentor relationships, and educational continuation beyond secondary school. Results reveal that, for both white and black males, DRD2 A1+ (A1A1 and A1A2 genotypes) is associated with a decreased likelihood of school continuation compared to their counterparts with DRD2 A1-; mentors who are teachers compensate for this negative association (a G x E); and youth with DRD2 A1+ are less likely to have a mentor who is a teacher than their counterparts with DRD2 A1- (a rGE).

AB Research on psychological wellbeing has received far less attention than mental illness and has created a gap in our understanding of positive mental health. This research is even more sparse among adolescents. The present study examined the correlates of one measure of psychological wellbeing, positive affect, in the adolescent population. Two dimensions of school support (teacher-student relationship and student engagement) and family support (family communication and family closeness) were examined. Because previous studies suggest these correlates may be affected by race and gender, analysis was conducted in the total sample and in disaggregated subpopulations. A nationally representative sample of US adolescents (n=10,148) from the National Comorbidity SurveyAdolescent Supplement was analyzed in this study. Structural equation models were used for analysis. Latinos reported significantly lower positive affect than Whites. Males reported higher levels of positive affect than females. Blacks and Latinos reported lower perceptions of family communication than Whites and higher school emotional support than Whites. Females reported lower family communication, lower family closeness, and higher school support than males. Analysis revealed that among the total sample, all dimensions of school and family support measured were correlates of positive affect. When the total sample was divided by gender and race there were marked differences in the relationship between school and family support across subpopulations. Males and Whites most closely resembled the total sample while the relationship between dimensions of school and family support were distinct for females and racial ethnic minorities. This study provides an examination of how psychosocial mechanisms operate similarly and differently across adolescent subgroups. In line with other studies, findings provide evidence of differences by race and gender. This study is relevant to social workers because the findings have implications for both assessment and intervention.

AB Representative bureaucracy has been investigated empirically and debated normatively, but there exists little evidence about how the general public views representative bureaucracy-especially the legitimacy of active representation. Using a survey experiment, this article explores people's fairness judgments of active representation in two important social and policy contexts: education and gender, and policing and race. Results from an online sample of U.S. adults show that, in the case of education, a female teacher helping a female student was judged to be unfair, with the negative effect mainly coming from the male respondents in the study. In the case of policing, a white officer acting favorably toward a white citizen was judged to be unfair, with the negative effect driven largely by black and Hispanic respondents in the study. Implications for representative bureaucracy theory and research, as well as policy and practice, are discussed.

AB This study examined whether the links between children's ADHD symptom severity and academic and social functioning varied based on their aerobic fitness levels. Hierarchical regression models were used to examine the main and interactive effects of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive (HI) symptom severity and aerobic fitness levels on academic and social functioning in 198 children (Mage = 6.83; 53% male; 68% White, 14% Mixed Race, 8% Black or African American; 2% Asian; 8% selected the "Other" category when reporting racial identity; across race categories, 15% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity). Children's aerobic fitness levels were assessed using a multistage fitness test. Parents rated children's ADHD symptoms, and teachers rated academic and social functioning. Results highlighted negative associations between ADHD symptom severity and adaptive academic and social functioning. Aerobic fitness was positively linked with academic performance. Aerobic fitness moderated the associations between HI symptom severity and academic outcomes, highlighting that aerobic fitness may be protective against academic impairments for children with elevated HI symptoms.

AB Small group social skills training (SST) is recommended to improve the social behavior and peer relations of rejected children, but child responses vary. This study explored variation in intervention experiences that emerged in a large study of a school-based SST program for peer-rejected children and associations with program outcomes. One hundred and seven peer-rejected elementary students (60% White, 15% Black, 22% Latinx, 3% Multi-racial, and 65% male) were identified by classroom sociometrics and randomly assigned to a year-long small group SST program. Normative classmates served as partners. Among the peer-rejected targets of the intervention, those with relatively better pretreatment social skills received more SST sessions and were more positively engaged, whereas those with fewer social skills and more behavior problems experienced more negative peer responses during SST sessions and less collateral support from teachers and parents. Hierarchical regressions (controlling for pretreatment scores) revealed attenuated intervention benefits for children who received more negative peer responses during SST and less parent and teacher support. The findings suggest that, within a sample of peer-rejected children, those with more severe skill deficits and elevated behavior problems at pretreatment have lower-quality SST experiences that reduce intervention benefits, even when normative classmates serve as peer partners. These issues warrant careful attention in future SST intervention design and research.

AB Urban middle school physical education teachers undertook action research to understand activity preferences of their sixth and seventh graders (n = 701) as they sought to modify curriculum for enhancing of basic demographic characteristics and interest in participating in 24 physical education activities. Responses were analyzed by vector analysis where the magnitude and direction of preference was taken into account to generate standardized T-scores Difference scores were used to compare preferences by gender, ethnicity, and grade, with |T-difference| greater than 16.4 considered significant (p <.05). For gender, males more preferred football and females more preferred volleyball, yoga, and jump rope than the opposite gender. For ethnicity, Hispanics more preferred soccer than Asians; and Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians more preferred their own ethnonymic games and dance activities than their counterparts. Preference differences were not found between grades. Urban physical educators-and possibly others-should consider gender and ethnic-based preferences when making curricular content and pedagogical decisions.

AB Risk of developing multiple myeloma (MM) rises with age and is greater among men and blacks than among women and whites, respectively, and possibly increased among obese persons. Other risk factors remain poorly understood. By pooling data from two complementary epidemiologic studies, we assessed whether obesity, smoking, or alcohol consumption alters MM risk and whether female reproductive history might explain the lower occurrence of MM in females than in males.
   The Los Angeles County MM Case-Control Study (1985-1992) included 278 incident cases and 278 controls, matched on age, sex, race, and neighborhood of residence at case's diagnosis. We estimated MM risk using conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). In the prospective California Teachers Study (CTS), 152 women were diagnosed with incident MM between 1995 and 2009; we calculated hazard ratios using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Data from the two studies were pooled using a stratified, nested case-control sampling scheme (10:1 match) for the CTS; conditional logistic regression among 430 cases and 1,798 matched controls was conducted.
   Obesity and smoking were not associated with MM risk in the individual or combined studies. Alcohol consumption was associated with decreased MM risk among whites only (pooled OR = 0.66, 95 % CI = 0.49-0.90) for ever versus never drinking. Higher gravidity and parity were associated with increased MM risk, with pooled ORs of 1.38 (95 % CI = 1.01-1.90) for a parts per thousand yen3 versus 1-2 pregnancies and 1.50 (95 % CI = 1.09-2.06) for a parts per thousand yen3 versus 1-2 live births.
   Female reproductive history may modestly alter MM risk, but appears unlikely to explain the sex disparity in incidence. Further investigation in consortial efforts is warranted.

TI Instructor Name Preference and Student Evaluations of Instruction
SO PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE & POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
ID TEACHER IMMEDIACY; MOTIVATION; BEHAVIORS; RATINGS; GENDER
AB Student evaluations of instruction (SEIs) have an important role in hiring, firing, and promotion decisions. However, evidence suggests that SEIs might be influenced by factors other than teaching skills. The author examined several nonteaching factors that may impact SEIs in two independent studies. Study 1 examined whether an instructor's name preference (i.e., first name versus "Dr." last name) influenced SEIs in actual courses. Study 2 implemented a two (i.e., instructor name preference: first name or "Dr." last name) by two (i.e., instructor gender: male or female) by two (i.e., instructor race: white or Black) between-subjects design for SEIs in a hypothetical course. Study 1 found that SEIs were higher when the female instructor expressed a preference for being called by her first name. Study 2 found the highest SEIs for Black male instructors when instructors asked students to call them by their first name, but there was a decrease in SEI scores if they went by their professional title. Administrators should be aware of the various factors that can influence how students evaluate instructors.

AB This study investigated the utility of including teacher-reported callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors in the assessment of disruptive behaviors in school-based research. Participants included 138 first- and second-grade children (68% male; 76% eligible for free or reduced-price lunch; 61% Black, 9% Latinx, 23% White, and 7% multiracial) who completed assessments during the baseline assessment of an intervention study. Results indicated that teachers could distinguish CU from traditional indicators of disruptive behavior, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) behaviors and conduct problems (CP). When considered alone, there was mixed evidence for the utility of CU behaviors. Although higher levels of CU behaviors explained unique variation in teacher-reported social competence and global impairment, CU behaviors did not explain unique variation in disciplinary infractions, classroom behavior, or academic functioning after accounting for ADHD and CP behaviors. A different pattern of results was evident when CU was considered in conjunction with ADHD and CP behaviors. Latent profile analyses identified three subgroups of participants (i.e., a nondisruptive group, an ADHD group, and a comorbid group, who exhibited elevated levels of ADHD, CP, and CU). Compared to the nondisruptive group, the ADHD group exhibited higher rates of off-task classroom behavior and worse academic functioning. The comorbid group exhibited moderate-to-large differences from both groups on teacher-reported and objective outcomes. The implications of these results are discussed with respect to the potential value of incorporating CU behaviors, which are becoming prominent in clinical psychology and psychiatry, into school-based research and for school psychology practice.
   Impact and Implications
   CU behaviors often co-occur with disruptive behaviors and contribute to profound impairment in interpersonal functioning. Consideration of CU behaviors as a part of the assessment of disruptive behaviors may help to reduce heterogeneity among children who qualify for an emotional disturbance, per the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act. Moreover, ongoing efforts among clinical scientists to develop innovative treatments and to personalize treatments for children with CU behaviors may inform similar efforts by school psychologists.

AB AUTHORS' NOTE: The stories and portraits presented in this article emerge from our respective experiences with a previous student while teaching in San Francisco and from research at a credit recovery program in a large urban high school in Boston. One of us, David, is a black male and special education teacher at a Boston arts high school. The other, Anita, is a South Asian female who coordinates a restorative justice program at an alternative high school in Houston. We hope that these portraits reveal how relationships among adults, students, and communities influence individuals as well as whole-school structures. We also hope to show that resilience is much more than a "special something" possessed by the few, but something experienced by many students and the adults who support them. At the same time, we witness how the school-to-prison pipeline hinders the resilience of many urban students of color. Therefore, to ground ourselves in an issue relevant to our times, we show the promise restorative justice practices hold in the nurturing of resilience. Yours, in solidarity, ANITAWADHWA AND DAVID KNIGHT

DE abolition; fugitive; knowing; literacy; pandemic; political
AB The author complements his JoLLE keynote speech, available on video, with an essay that situates historical means of oppression within two current pandemics: the coronavirus crisis and the longstanding crisis of White supremacy. He expands this notion to include societal advantage beyond Whiteness, particularly the advantages that accrue to wealthy, western European descended, able-bodied, cis-gender, Protestant, heterosexual males, whose lives have been normalized to represent all that is right and good. Schools, he maintains, are structured to support the value system of a single demographic group, making U.S. schooling fundamentally unjust extensions of discrimination more broadly practiced. He asserts that teachers dedicated to abolishing oppressive systems must teach to refute what the world says about Black and Brown youth. He maintains that a post-pandemic world would abandon its orientation to markets and status quo preservation. Rather, it will shift its emphasis to a commitment to cultivating students' knowledge of themselves, their solidarity as members of a community, and their self-determination beyond the bounds of the discriminatory structures that have long dominated US society and its schools.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the longitudinal association between externalizing and internalizing behavior and children's academic achievement, particularly in terms of whether these variables varied as a function of gender and race. Data pertaining to externalizing and internalizing behavior, academic achievement, gender, and race from three waves of the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N = 2028) were used. Results indicate that behavior problems had a negative relationship with academic performance and some of these associations endured overtime. Externalizing behavior impacted reading scores more negatively for females compared to males at baseline, but the impact of externalizing behavior on long-term reading outcomes did not vary by gender. Externalizing behavior impacted reading scores more negatively for Black children than White children at multiple points in time. Differences between males, females, Black, and White children concerning behavior and achievement are explained. Implications, limitations, and ideas for future research are also presented.

AB Objective: Assessing race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) relationships with AttentionDeficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis, treatment, and access to care has yielded inconsistent results often based only on parent-report. In contrast, this study used broader ADHD diagnostic determination including case-definition to examine these relationships in a multisite elementary-school-based sample. Method: Secondary analysis of children with and without ADHD per parent and teacher-reported Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria evaluated SES, race/ethnicity, and other variables through simple bivariate/multivariable models within and across: parent-reported diagnosis, medication treatment, and meeting ADHD study case-definition. Results: The total sample included 51.9% male, 51.3% White, and 53.1% with private insurance; 10% had parent-reported ADHD diagnoses while 8.3% met ADHD study case-definition. In multivariable models, White children had higher odds of parent-reported diagnoses than Black, Hispanic, and Other Race/ Ethnicity children (p < 0.05), but only Hispanic children had lower odds of being case-positive (< 0.05); males and children in single-parent households had higher odds of parent-reported diagnoses and being case-positive (p < 0.05); and children who were White, male, and had health insurance had higher odds of taking medication (p < 0.05). Among children who were case-positive, those with Medicaid, White, and 2-parent statuses had higher odds of parent-reported diagnoses (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Children with underlying ADHD appear more likely to have assessment/medication treatment access if they are White, male, have health insurance (particularly Medicaid), and live in 2-parent households. While boys and children raised by single parents may have higher rates of ADHD diagnoses, false-positive diagnostic risk also appeared higher, inviting further investigation.

AB A mixed-methods study enabled the exploration of New York City high school data, analyzing performance/demographic scores based on principal and/or student gender, boroughs, and other factors found the following: Significant differences in boroughs' college and career readiness scores, chi(2)(4, N = 369) = 26.830, p = .00, with (a) the highest mean rank of 251 for Staten Island, and the lowest mean rank of 156 for Brooklyn; (b) larger socioeconomically integrated schools more successful; (c) failure in small Manhattan and Bronx segregated/poverty female-majority schools; and (d) male students, F(4, 359) = 2.49, p = .043, partial eta(2) = .027, attained significantly lower scores. Enrollment was significant, F(1, 457) = 7.215, p < .05 partial eta(2) = .940, with male principals (M = 746.40, SD = 903.58) leading larger schools. Recommendations include the following: gifted vocational education school, gauging for feminization, more Black/Hispanic principals; and assurance of licensed vocational educators.

AB In this paper drawing on a study about school dress code policies and related issues-such as multiculturalism, racism, sexism, and homophobia, in the professional discourse-I show how similar the two patriarchal and White supremacist structures of education (school) and law enforcement (police) work. I argue that sexism, racism, homophobia, and classism in formal and hidden curriculum could be as mortal and brutal as it happened in cases of Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, and others. Dress codes convey sexism with a male center gaze and racism with White middle-class norms that serve as a hidden curriculum with inherent biases. That is, not acting White, not being lady-like, wearing butch-tomboy or ragged clothing, is disruptive to academic success. Discussing a dress code in a high school in a working-class Black community, I argue that like police officers, educators tend to make dangerous judgments about bodies. Finally, to stop the harmful reproduction of such judgments, I suggest what Judith Butler calls "subversive repetition" and "subversive citation" (Butler 1990, p. 147) which allows resisting the everyday experiences that produce oneself to address the question that how can we, as teachers, school administrations, and teacher educators, resist those practices that produce our bodies as vulnerable and potential victims and others' bodies as dangerous and potential violators. To problematize, to conceptualize, and to enhance the above-mentioned argument, I will draw on several feminist frameworks such as performativity (Butler 1990), intersectionality (Crenshaw 1989), and objectification (Fredrickson and Roberts 1997).

TI Reimagining Home: Redemption and Resistance in Hawai'i Women's Prison
   Writing
SO SIGNS
LA English
DT Article
AB Women's plight in the prison-industrial complex resounds within a disturbing American narrative: the disproportionate incarceration of nonwhites in our prison-industrial gulag. Prisons in Hawai'i indicate an ongoing colonial relationship to the United States, which overthrew the Hawaiian kingdom by force. While historical and contemporary prison literature addresses the black male as the most marked body in the prison-industrial complex, this article highlights the testimony of women, including that of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women, who are overrepresented in Hawai'i's carceral landscape. My research, rooted in my experiences between 2012 and 2016 as a feminist ethnographer and creative writing teacher at the sole women's prison on O'ahu-the Women's Correctional Community Center (WCCC), which warehouses three hundred women of mixed security levels-addresses a scholarly lacuna in a tradition that privileges male prison writing by examining women's prison writing in two gender-responsive programs: the Kailua Prison Writing Project and its adjacent Prison Monologues. The philosophy of the writing program is rooted in Hawaiian practices ofho'oponopono(reconciliation and forgiveness), which resist state-sanctioned inscriptions on Indigenous bodies. Imagined by its founders as a place of refuge and a transgressive cultural site, WCCC is also a troubled site: a feminized (domesticated) carceral landscape against a backdrop of colonialism, a space between hope and despair. The women who write in an incarcerated space perform resistance even as they confound the anticipations of readers familiar with an incarcerated male authorship. Yet as the women themselves attest, they are never immune to institutional intrusions and fracture.

AB Individuals with ADHD symptoms are at an increased risk of lifetime trauma exposure. However, research has yet to fully examine whether symptoms of ADHD function as a temporal risk factor for experiencing trauma and specific mechanisms that may explain the association between symptoms of ADHD and trauma exposure. Two constructs that may account for the relation between ADHD symptoms and trauma are deviant peer association and neighborhood disadvantage. The present study sought to 1) elucidate the temporal nature of ADHD symptoms and exposure to trauma and 2) examine whether peer deviancy and/or neighborhood disadvantage mediate the relation between childhood ADHD symptoms and subsequent trauma exposure across a 20-year longitudinal cohort study. Participants (N = 616) were predominantly Black/African American (86%; Male n = 389) from an urban school district. Using structural equation modeling, total trauma exposures during young adulthood (Years 17-20) were regressed on parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms in Grade 1 (Year 1). A significant indirect path from ADHD symptoms to trauma exposure through deviant peer affiliation (Year 16) indicated that having childhood ADHD symptoms predicted deviant peer affiliation 16 years later, which in turn predicted greater exposures to traumatic events during young adulthood, controlling for neighborhood disadvantage. Neighborhood disadvantage was not a significant mediator when accounting for peer deviancy. Taken together, findings contribute to a limited body of research that utilizes a prospective design to examine the association between childhood ADHD symptoms and trauma exposure in young adulthood among Black/African American youth. Potential targets for intervention are proposed.

AB The current study explored adolescents' perceptions of what contributes to their experiences of success in a rural Title I school through interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Participants included adolescents who were enrolled at a rural Title I Middle/High School in the southern United States. The single campus school district serves approximately 185 students from Prekindergarten to grade 12. Approximately, 73% of the students are identified as At-Risk, 88% of the students are economically disadvantaged, and 100% of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch. Ten students from this school, with assent and parental consent, participated in the current study. Participants' ages ranged from 13 to 18, and the students represented different genders (seven males, three females) and various racial and ethnic backgrounds (three Black/African American, four Latinx, two White, and one Biracial). Results from the current study suggest low-income adolescents in a rural Title I school perceived (a) school size, (b) family support, and (c) their own internal drive to succeed as contributing to their success at school. These themes, their corresponding subthemes, and representative participant statements are included. Implications for school administrators, teachers, and counselors along with directions for future research are discussed.

AB Objective: The study examined the effects of therapeutic alliance (TA; relational bond, task collaboration) on externalizing behavior outcomes, how TA can operate differently when children are seen in individual versus group sessions, and how therapist-child disagreement in perceptions of TA affects outcomes. Method: Three hundred sixty children (Ages 9.2-11.8; 65% male; 78.1% Black) identified as having high rates of aggressive behavior by the fourth-grade teachers, and their 20 elementary schools were randomized to group versus individual delivery of the cognitive behavioral intervention, Coping Power. TA ratings were collected from children and therapists at mid and end of intervention using the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children. Teacher ratings of children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems were collected prior to intervention and at 1-year follow-up after intervention using the Behavior Assessment System for Children. Results: Children receiving the intervention individually reported significantly higher trait-like levels of task collaboration than did children seen in groups. Independent of intervention format, higher trait-like levels of therapist-rated bond and task collaboration predicted reduced levels of externalizing problems, and higher trait-like levels of child- and therapist-rated task-collaboration and therapist-rated bond predicted reduced levels of internalizing problems. Differences between therapist and child reports of bond predicted weaker reductions in internalizing behavior for children seen in groups. Conclusions: It is essential to train therapists to develop and assess for TA by midintervention with children with aggressive behavior problems, especially if they are seen in small groups, and to determine if therapists may misperceive the strength of TA.

TI Community Readiness to Adopt the Communities That Care Prevention System

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE

DT Article
ID YOUTH PROBLEM BEHAVIORS; BASE-LINE; DESIGN; RISK
AB Introduction: This manuscript highlights initial activities from a 5-year project to build a community coalition focused on the promotion of family, school, and community connectedness; academic investment; and social and emotional well-being among black male youth and their families, as well as the prevention and reduction of risk behaviors. Project activities were planned according to the step-by-step coalition-based prevention system, Communities That Care.
   Methods: During Year 1 (2013/2014), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 community members (parents, school administrators and teachers, and community leaders and volunteers) to evaluate readiness to adopt Communities That Care. Participants were asked to (1) define community; (2) identify community strengths; (3) recommend methods to strengthen community relationships; (4) envision ideal coalition functions; (5) identify current community resources; (6) recommend prevention targets and methods; (7) identify potential barriers to coalition participation; and (8) assess overall community readiness to adopt Communities That Care. Analyses were conducted in Year 3 (2015/2016).
   Results: Participants expressed eagerness and readiness to adopt Communities That Care. They identified community strengths and local resources that could contribute to coalition success, as well as potential barriers to participation and group cohesion that if left unaddressed could diminish coalition impact. Participants believed that links between multiple environments (home, school, community) should be strengthened in order to promote the well-being of youth. They envisioned the Communities That Care coalition as a task force of community members with varying talents invested in youth across their entire life course.
   Conclusions: Community members' insights may be used to guide implementation of Communities That Care by this coalition and others.

AB Identification of the early determinants of substance abuse is a major focus of life course research. In this study, we investigated the child, family, and school-related antecedents of the onset and prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 for a cohort of 1208 low-income minority children in the Chicago Longitudinal Study. Data on well-being have been collected prospectively since birth from administrative records, parents, teachers, and children. Results indicated that the prevalence of substance abuse by age 26 was 26% (self-reports or criminal justice system records) with a median age of first use of 17. Probit regression analysis indicated that substance abuse prevalence was primarily determined by gender (males had a higher rate), trouble-making behavior by age 12, school mobility, and previous substance use. Family and peer predictors included involvement in the child welfare system by age 9, parent expectations for school success at age 9, parent substance abuse by child's age 15, and deviant peer affiliation by age 16. Age of first substance use was predicted by gender and race/ethnicity (males and Blacks had earlier incidence), involvement in the child welfare system, and family risk status at age 8. As with prevalence, the pattern of predictors for males was similar to the overall sample but the magnitude of effects was stronger. The predictors of the timing of substance use dependency were gender, family conflict by age 5, involvement in the child welfare system, social maturity at age 9, adolescent school mobility, and school dropout by age 16. Findings indicate that the promotion of family involvement and positive school and social behaviors can reduce the risk of substance abuse. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship and combined influence of racial identity and Africentric values on African American children's psychosocial adjustment. Participants were 104 (53 males, 51 females) African American fourth-grade students attending an inner-city public school in a northeastern city. Child and teacher ratings were used to assess the relationship between racial identity, Africentric values, and several indices of child psychosocial adjustment, including child behavior control, school interest, and teacher perceptions of child strengths and problems in the classroom. Child self-esteem and the effects of gender and cohort were used as covariates in several analyses in the study. Overall, findings from the study supported the usefulness of combining racial identity and Africentric values into a single model of ethnic identification for African American children. Implications for risk prevention and enhancement of psychosocial functioning among African American children are discussed.

AB Many organizations want to achieve diversity, yet who "counts" as contributing to diversity is malleable. Across four experiments, we explore how contextual influences shape perceptions of diversity, including what happens when information at different contextual levels conflicts. In Study 1 (N = 160) and Study 2 (N = 69, preregistered), we find that when participants believe White women, White men, and Black men to be overrepresented in a profession at the national level, individuals with those identities are rated as contributing less to the diversity of a group of workers within that profession. In Study 3 (N = 164), participants were asked to make diversity judgments within the same profession (American elementary school teachers), but the composition of the target group under evaluation was either White female-dominated (aligned with the profession) or White male-dominated (diverged from the profession). Presenting the group as White male-dominated (compared to White female-dominated) increased perceptions of White women's contributions to diversity and decreased perceptions of White men's, and men of color's, contributions to diversity. In Study 4 (N = 216, preregistered), we attempted to call participants' attention to representation at a single level only (i.e., national vs. target group), when representation information conflicted across levels. However, perceived contributions to diversity did not shift based on experimental conditions. It appears that Americans' judgments of who increases a group's diversity can be affected by representation at multiple levels, although it may be difficult for perceivers to prioritize one contextual level only when such information conflicts.

AB Researchers consistently find a correlation between low literacy levels and high school dropout rates, expulsion, reading achievement, and failing grades for African American males. Low literacy achievement in African American males may result from multiple factors, including dialectic linguistic differences and/or phonological awareness abilities. Phonological deficits are consistently associated with dyslexia. This article documents results from a metacognitive flexibility-based phonological intervention designed to mitigate the effects of dialect differences and phonological awareness among African American boys. Based on their scaled scores on the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing-Second Edition Elision subtest, we placed participants in 2 different groups: low phonological awareness (n = 13) and average phonological awareness (n = 17). The 4-week intervention included manipulative phonemic procedures targeting final consonant patterns with an emphasis on a metacognitive understanding of phonological differences between African American English and academic English. We analyzed pre- and posttest data on resulting reading achievement, phonological awareness, and dialect variation using multivariate analysis of variance/multivariate analysis of covariance. We used hierarchical regression to analyze the prediction of reading achievement scores. The findings of this study suggest several recommendations for teachers to increase phonological awareness abilities among students who are at risk for reading difficulties. Teachers can also implement explicit instruction combining phonemic manipulation and verbal scaffolding related to a metacognitive understanding of the phonological differences between African American English and academic English.

TI Performance Gaps Between Online and Face-to-Face Courses: Differences
   Across Types of Students and Academic Subject Areas
SO JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION

ID COMMUNITY; PRINCIPLES; ENROLLMENT; EDUCATION; DISTANCE; IMPACT
AB Using a dataset containing nearly 500,000 courses taken by over 40,000 community and technical college students in Washington State, this study examines the performance gap between online and face-to-face courses and how the size of that gap differs across student subgroups and academic subject areas. While all types of students in the study suffered decrements in performance in online courses, those with the strongest declines were males, younger students, Black students, and students with lower grade point averages. Online performance gaps were also wider in some academic subject areas than others. After controlling for individual and peer effects, the social sciences and the applied professions (e.g., business, law, and nursing) showed the strongest online performance gaps.

AB The present study used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort of 2011 ( N = 15,827; 51.1% male; 48.4% White, 13.5% Black/African-American, 24.3% Hispanic/Latinx, 7.5% Asian, and 6.3% other ethnicity) to examine the unique contribution of specific executive function processes (working memory and cognitive flexibility) at kindergarten entry on externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in spring of kindergarten, after controlling for fall behavior problems and demographic covariates. Due to the transition to elementary school being a critical identification and prevention period, we also focused on examining the moderating role of specific positive parenting practices (i.e., cognitive stimulation, warmth, and behavior management) on associations between child executive function processes and behavioral functioning. Results indicated working memory was negatively associated with parent-reported externalizing and teacher-rated internalizing behavior problems. Further, the association between working memory and parent-rated externalizing problems was moderated by cognitive stimulation, whereas the association between parent-rated internalizing problems was moderated by behavior management. Cognitive flexibility did not have any significant associations. We discuss implications for research and practice on how parenting practices may be leveraged to improve child outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVES To compare the effectiveness of care management combined with a patient portal versus a portal alone for communication among children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   METHODS Randomized controlled trial conducted at 11 primary care practices. Children aged 5 to 12 years old with ADHD were randomly assigned to care management + portal or portal alone. The portal included parent-reported treatment preferences and goals, medication side effects, and parent- and teacher-reported ADHD symptom scales. Care managers provided education to families; communicated quarterly with parents, teachers, and clinicians; and coordinated care. The main outcome, changes in the Vanderbilt Parent Rating Scale (VPRS) score as a measure of ADHD symptoms, was assessed using intention-to-treat analysis.
   RESULTS A total of 303 eligible children (69% male; 46% Black) were randomly assigned, and 273 (90%) completed the study. During the 9-month study, parents in the care management + portal arm communicated inconsistently with care managers (mean 2.2; range 0-6) but similarly used the portal (mean 2.3 vs 2.2) as parents in the portal alone arm. In multivariate models, VPRS scores decreased over time (Adjusted beta = -.015; 95% confidence interval -0.023 to -0.07) in both groups, but there were no intervention-by-time effects (Adjusted beta = .000; 95% confidence interval -0.011 to 0.012) between groups. Children who received >= 2 care management sessions had greater reductions in VPRS scores than those with fewer sessions.
   CONCLUSIONS Results did not provide evidence that care management combined with a patient portal was different from portal use alone among children with ADHD. Both groups demonstrated similar reductions in ADHD symptoms. Those families with greater care management engagement demonstrated greater reductions than those with less engagement.

AB We use random assignment of role models to cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point to investigate the effect of same-gender or same-race mentors on occupation choice in the United States Army. Women and racial minorities have traditionally been underrepresented in certain occupations in the Army, and these disparities seem to persist over time. We find that when a female cadet is assigned a female mentor, the cadet is 4.60 and 18.1 percentage points more likely to pick her officer's branch as her first or among her top three occupational preferences, respectively, than if she had interacted with a male mentor. These results are robust to controlling for a limited choice set for females and a host of alternative specifications. We find that black cadets paired with black officers are 6.1 percentage points more likely to pick their role model's branch than if the black cadet had worked with a white officer. These results show that having a same-gender or same-race mentor may influence the occupation choice of women or racial minorities.

TI Guiding Questions for a Culturally Responsive Framework During
   Preemployment Transition Services
SO TEACHING EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN
LA English
DT Article
AB Kenya is a Black woman and a new vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselor. Her colleagues are Jessica, a White special education teacher, and Rachel, a White transition specialist. The transition team is working with Jalen, an 18-year-old Black male with a learning disability. He lives with his younger sisters and mother in a small rural town. His younger sisters are 7 and 9 years old, and his mother expects him to care for them after school while she is at work.
   Jalen also cuts his friends' hair out of his mother's house to earn extra money for the household. His mother is hesitant about allowing him to cut hair while she is away from home. However, she understands that cutting hair is his passion and working from home allows him to care for his sisters. As a career goal, Jalen would like to own a barbershop, like his Uncle Leon. He looks up to his Uncle Leon, who has encouraged him to attend barber school to earn a barbering license.
   Kenya, Jessica, and Rachel are at odds about how to best support Jalen for preemployment transition services (pre-ETS). Kenya is focused on leveraging Jalen's work experience and the individualized plan for employment (IPE). Jessica is focused on creating an individualized education plan (IEP) and transition plan that Jalen can reasonably meet to graduate on time and is concerned about his ability to pass the English state test that he desperately needs to graduate with a standard high school diploma. Rachel is focused on making sure his educational and vocational goals align but is worried that home responsibilities should be solely his mother's priority. The education team is lost on how best to collaborate in supporting Jalen's transition goal of becoming a barber.

   CONSENSUS
AB To assess sources of variability in platelet function tests in normal subjects, 64 healthy young adults were tested on 2-6 occasions at 2week intervals using four methods: platelet aggregation (AGG) in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the Bio/Data PAP-4 Aggregometer (BD) and Chrono-Log Lumi-Aggregometer (CL); and AGG in whole blood (WB) in the CL and Multiplate Platelet Function Analyser (MP), with ATP release (REL) in CL-PRP and CL-WB. Food and medication exposures were recorded prospectively for 2weeks prior to each blood draw. At least one AGG abnormality was seen in 21% of 81 drug-free specimens with CL-PRP, 15% with CL-WB, 13% with BD-PRP and 6% with MP-WB, increasing with inclusion of REL to 28% for CL-PRP and 30% for CL-WB. Epinephrine AGG and REL were significantly reduced in males (P<00001). Ristocetin AGG and collagen and thrombin REL were significantly reduced in Blacks (P<00001). One-third of specimens drawn following flavonoid-rich food exposures had aberrant results, compared to 85% of specimens without such exposures (P=00035). PRP tests had less intra-individual variation than WB tests. Gender, race, diet and test system affected results of platelet function testing in healthy subjects, suggesting caution when interpreting the results of platelet function testing in patients.

AB There is strong evidence linking children's self-regulation with their academic and behavioral outcomes. These relations have led to the development of interventions aimed at improving academic outcomes by promoting self-regulation, based in part on the idea that self-regulation promotes the development of academic skills. Although a considerable number of studies have examined the degree to which interventions designed to improve aspects of self-regulation have a positive impact on academic outcomes, only a few studies have examined the degree to which children's self regulation moderates the effects of academic interventions. The goal of this study was to examine whether self-regulation, indexed by a direct assessment of executive function and teacher-rated attention, moderated the uptake of early literacy interventions for 184 children (average age = 58 months, SD = 3.38; 66% Black/ African American, 28% White; 59% male) at risk for reading difficulties who participated in a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of Tier 2 interventions in preschool. Multilevel models were used to examine the degree to which children's self regulation moderated the impacts of the interventions. The results of this study provided little evidence that self-regulation moderated the impacts of the interventions and call into question the likelihood of a causal relation between self-regulation and aca-demic achievement.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study aims to evaluate the effects of asparagus pomace with different particle size (similar to 10 mu m, similar to 30 mu m, and similar to 80 mu m) on intestinal function and health. One hundred and forty male Kunming mice were divided into fourteen groups and were used for small intestine movement experiment, defecation experiment, and intestinal function and health experiment, respectively. Results showed that, asparagus pomace samples treatment could markedly alleviate the constipation caused by loperamide with improved intestinal propulsion rate, reduced initial time of the first black stool, and increased the total mass of faeces within 6 h (P < 0.05), and finer samples worked better. All asparagus pomace-treated groups could significantly reduce the cecum ammonia concentration, increase the faeces dry weight and moisture content, and lower the beta-D-glucosidase and beta-D-glucuronidase activities. However, the difference in aforementioned properties between similar to 10 mu m and similar to 30 mu m groups were not significant (P > 0.05), and the respective maximal efficiency were observed when the sample was ranged within the size in similar to 30 mu m, which indicated that a rational granularity can meet its objectives. This paper is expected to provide new insights of pulverization on functional properties of fiber-rich food materials.

AB Children's early emotion regulation strategies (ERS) have been related to externalizing problems; however, most studies have included predominantly European American, middle-class children. The current study explores whether ERS use may have differential outcomes as a function of the mother's ethnic culture. The study utilizes two diverse samples of low-income male toddlers to examine observed ERS during a delay of gratification task in relation to maternal and teacher reports of children's externalizing behavior 2 to 6 years later. Although the frequencies of ERS were comparable between ethnic groups in both samples, the use of physical comfort seeking and self-soothing was positively related to African American children's later externalizing behavior but negatively related to externalizing behavior for European American children in Sample 1. Data from Sample 2 appear to support this pattern for self-soothing in maternal, but not teacher, report of externalizing behavior. Within group differences by income were examined as a possible explanatory factor accounting for the ethnic differences, but it was not supported. Alternative explanations are discussed to explain the pattern of findings.

AB Background/objectivesObesity and other predictors of type 2 diabetes disproportionally affect Hispanic and Black children in the US compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children. Yet, the prevalence of prediabetes in children remains unestablished, and guidelines for screening young children are lacking. This study examined the relationships between demographic factors and prediabetes in vulnerable youth in central Texas.Subjects/methodsThis is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from 976 3rd-5th graders (7-12 years) who participated in TX Sprouts, a school-based gardening, nutrition, and cooking trial in 16 elementary schools serving mainly children from minority backgrounds and lower-income households. Measures collected included age, sex, ethnicity, free/reduced-priced school lunch (FRL) status, parent educational attainment (questionnaires), BMI from height (stadiometer) and weight (TANITA scale), and prediabetes status from fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c. Regressions examined cross-sectional associations between demographics and FPG, HbA1c, and prediabetes.ResultsChildren were 47% male, 67% Hispanic, and 10% Black, with a mean age of 9.3 years; 71% received FRL, 50% had overweight/obesity, and 26% had prediabetes. Prediabetes rates were 2.8 and 4.8 times higher in Hispanic and Black children compared to NHW children, respectively (p & LE; 0.001), and 1.5 times higher in children with obesity versus normal BMI (p = 0.02). Children of parents with only an 8th-grade education, some high school education, or a high school degree had 3.1, 2.7, and 2.2 times higher odds of having prediabetes compared to children of college graduates, respectively (p & LE; 0.004). Analyses with FPG and HbA1c yielded similar results.ConclusionThese findings suggest a potential need for earlier screening, more comprehensive testing guidelines, and prevention programs tailored toward minority children, children with obesity, and children of parents with low educational attainment. Future research should explore this finding in a larger, nationally representative sample.

AB This study examined the relationship between race-based traumatic stress symptoms and traditional trauma symptoms in Black Americans. Although research has shown that experiences of racial discrimination can result in stress and trauma reactions, less is known about how these symptoms present and their relationship with traditional trauma presentation. Participants were 230 community-based Black American adults (58.7% male). Criterion-related profile analysis was used to examine the level and arrangement of race-based traumatic stress symptoms which predict trauma reactions in participants who report varying levels of racial stress. Level of race-based traumatic stress symptoms were significant predictors of trauma across all groups. However, the presentation of symptoms predicting trauma reactions differed between the No-Racial Stress and Racial Stress groups. In the Racial Stress group, depression, intrusion, anger, and low self-esteem primarily drove the relation between race-based traumatic stress symptoms and trauma reactions. Notably, the presence of hypervigilance was not predictive of trauma reactions for those with racial stress. Pattern in symptom presentation was not significant for the Racial Trauma group. These findings provide support for consideration of different symptom presentation when assessing trauma resulting from racial encounters.

AB Scholars across disciplines and throughout PK-20 education have argued that color-blind ideology works to perpetuate racial inequities in education via policies, research, curriculum, instruction, and student-teacher interactions. This study explores an underexamined issue in relation to color-blind ideology in STEM education. Specifically, it examines how a sample of college science faculty members use color-blind framings to make sense of the underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students in their fields. Interviews were conducted with 42 professors (majority tenured/ tenure-track, white, male, and continuing generation to college) in a College of Sciences at a research-intensive, historically white institution in the United States. Thematic analysis showed that while many faculty members implicated systemic racism in their sense making about the underrepresentation of racially minoritized students in STEM, the majority used colorblind frames (abstract liberalism, cultural racism, and minimization of racism) by focusing on individual behaviors and choices, cultural deficits, under-preparation, and poverty. Consistent with the research on color-blind ideology, professors were able to explain racial phenomena without implicating race/racism, which allowed them to absolve themselves from responsibility in addressing racial inequality issues in higher education. Faculty members who made sense of underrepresentation through systemic racism framings tended to recognize that they had a role to play in ameliorating these issues for students of color. These findings have implications for future research and professional development efforts.

AB This paper analyzes the relationship between high school value-added and college performance, which contributes to the literature on (1) the relationship between value-added and adult outcomes and (2) the importance of high schools. One standard deviation increase in high school value-added is associated with an increase in the probability of graduating from college by 4?6 percentage points and final GPA by 0.04?0.08 points on a 4.0 scale, depending on controls for student, high school, geographic, university, and major selection effects. The associations are largest for male students and Black students. Most of the association with GPA occurs in early semesters.

AB This work focuses on Wes, a Black student in a 9th grade English Language Arts (ELA) class taught by Ms. Henry. Wes was socially identified as a violent, problematically challenging, and "naturally" academically unambitious student by Ms. Henry based on the perceptions of Wes drawn up from broader social discourses of race/gender identities and also from authorized institutional (school) "acceptable" and narrowly defined ways to perform classroom roles. Using discourse analysis to examine Wes's contributions during one classroom discussion, this work explores how Wes achieved identities other than those imputed on him while explicitly countering prevailing institutional notions of him as a Black adolescent, his linguistic practices, and by extension, speakers of Black Language.

TI Community Violence Exposure and Generalized Anxiety Symptoms: Do
   Callous-Unemotional Behaviors Moderate this Relation Among Urban Youth?
SO RESEARCH ON CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOPATHOLOGY

AB Community violence exposure (CVE; i.e., direct victimization and witnessed violence) is a major public health concern among youth who reside in low income, urban neighborhoods, who tend to experience CVE chronically and disproportionately. Frequent CVE is associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms, such as persistent or excessive worry and difficulty concentrating. However, not all youth experiencing CVE exhibit such symptoms. One understudied factor that may moderate this relation is callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors (e.g., behaviors consistent with lack of guilt, low levels of empathy). CU behaviors are associated with lower levels of responsiveness to contextual processes; as such, CU behaviors may be associated with lower levels of GAD symptoms in the context of CVE. However, little research considers CU behaviors and GAD symptoms concurrently. To address this gap, the present study examined associations among witnessed and direct CVE, CU behaviors, and GAD symptoms among low-income, urban youth (N = 104, 50% male, M-age = 9.93 +/- 1.22 years old, 95% African-American/Black). Multiple regression analyses indicated teacher-reported CU behaviors moderated the relations between CVE and caregiver-reported GAD symptoms. Post-hoc probing revealed that among youth with higher levels of CVE, higher levels of CU behaviors were associated with elevated GAD symptoms compared to their peers with lower levels of CU behaviors. Youth with lower levels of CU behaviors evidenced moderate levels of GAD symptoms regardless of their levels of CVE. Thus, low-income, urban youth who experience elevated levels of CVE may be at increased risk for co-occurring GAD and CU symptoms.

AB This study evaluated the sustained effects of the Re search-based D evelopmentally I nformed Parent pro-gram (REDI-P) at fifth grade, six years after intervention. Participants were 200 prekindergarten children attending Head Start (55% White, 26% Black, 19% Latinx, 56% male, mean age of 4.45 years at study ini-tiation) and their primary caregivers, who were randomly assigned to a control group or a 16-session home-visiting intervention that bridged the preschool and kindergarten years. In addition, the study ex-plored moderation of sustained effects by parenting risks (e.g., less than high-school education, single-parent status, parental depression, and low parent-child warmth). Growth curves over the course of the elementary years examined outcomes in three domains: child academic performance, social-emotional adjustment, and parent-child functioning. At fifth grade, significant main effects for intervention were sustained in the domains of academic performance (e.g., reading skills, academic motivation, and learning engagement) and parent-child functioning (e.g., academic expectations and parenting stress). Significant moderation by parenting risk emerged on measures of social-emotional adjustment (e.g., social compe-tence and student-teacher relationships); parenting risk also amplified effects on some measures of aca-demic performance and parent-child functioning, with larger effects for children from families experienc-ing fewer risks. Implications are discussed for the design of preschool home visiting programs seeking to enhance the school success and social-emotional well-being of children living in poverty.

AB This report presents results of a randomized trial of a state prekindergarten program. Low-income children (N=2990) applying to oversubscribed programs were randomly assigned to receive offers of admission or remain on a waiting list. Data from pre-k through 3rd grade were obtained from state education records; additional data were collected for a subset of children with parental consent (N = 1076). At the end of pre-k, pre-k participants in the consented subsample performed better than control children on a battery of achievement tests, with non-native English speakers and children scoring lowest at baseline showing the greatest gains. During the kindergarten year and thereafter, the control children caught up with the pre-k participants on those tests and generally surpassed them. Similar results appeared on the 3rd grade state achievement tests for the full randomized sample - pre-k participants did not perform as well as the control children. Teacher ratings of classroom behavior did not favor either group overall, though some negative treatment effects were seen in 1st and 2nd grade. There were differential positive pre-k effects for male and Black children on a few ratings and on attendance. Pre-k participants had lower retention rates in kindergarten that did not persist, and higher rates of school rule violations in later grades. Many pre-k participants received special education designations that remained through later years, creating higher rates than for control children. Issues raised by these findings and implications for pre-k policy are discussed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) and tobacco-cannabis coexposure (PTCE) co-occur with negative maternal emotional functioning (termed prenatal risks) and together increase risk for child regulatory problems at early school age (ESA). Little is known about developmental processes in early childhood that may mediate this association. We examined two hypothesized mediational processes linking prenatal risks to ESA emotion regulation (ER) and lability-negativity; parasympathetic functioning at toddler age and chronic risk reflected by continued postnatal maternal negative emotional functioning (i.e., depression, anger/hostility, and emotion dysregulation) and substance exposure. Congruent with differential susceptibility theory, we examined interactions between sensitive parenting and toddler parasympathetic functioning predicting ESA ER. Finally, we explored the role of child sex as a moderator. Mothers (N = 247; 53% male infants; 51% Black, 31% White, 19% Hispanic, and 8% other or mixed race) were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy into one of three groups: PTE (n = 81), PTCE (n = 97), and no substance exposure (n = 69) matched on age and education. Substance exposure was assessed using multiple methods, maternal negative emotional functioning via self-reports, parenting with observations, and child ER using teacher, maternal, and lab assessor reports. Results supported a chronic risk pathway with less support for a parasympathetic pathway. Toddlers who demonstrated respiratory sinus arrhythmia withdrawal to frustration were susceptible to the positive context of sensitive parenting in predicting higher ER. Results emphasize the importance of chronicity of postnatal risks including substance exposure and evaluating the differential impact of positive environments for children with substance exposure.

AB Purpose: We tested the significance of associations among students' demographics, communication styles, and feedback received during clerkships.
   Methods: US medical students who completed at least one required clinical clerkship were invited between April and July 2006 to complete an anonymous, online survey inquiring about demographics, communication styles (assertiveness and reticence), feedback (positive and negative), and clerkship grades. The effects of self-identified race/ethnicity, gender, and generation (immigrant, first- or second-generation American) and their 2-way interactions on assertiveness, reticence, total positive and total negative feedback comments were tested using factorial analysis of covariance, controlling for age, clerkship grades, and mother's and father's education; pairwise comparisons used simple contrasts. Two-sided P values < .05 were considered significant.
   Results: Medical students from 105 schools responded (N = 2395; 55% women; 57% white). Men reported more assertiveness than women (P = .001). Reticence (P < .001) and total positive comments (P = .006) differed by race/ethnicity; in pairwise contrasts, black, East Asian, and Native American/Alaskan students reported greater reticence than white students (P < .001), and white students reported receiving more positive comments than block, and South and East Asian students, Race/ethnicity-by-generation (P = .022) and gender-by-generation (P = .025) interaction effects were observed for total negative comments; white first-generation Americans reported receiving the fewest and male immigrants reported receiving the most negative comments.
   Conclusions: Demographic differences in students' communication styles and feedback they received highlight a need for cultural competency training to improve medical student-teacher interactions, analogous to training currently advocated to improve physician-patient interactions.

AB Adolescents use social identities and reasoning to make peer inclu-sion and attribution decisions. School climate plays a role in these decisions. Thus, this study analyzed how school racial climate and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) classroom cli-mate were associated with the choices of adolescents (N = 294; Mage = 15.72 years; 52.3 % female; 36.7 % White/European American, 32.9 % Black/African American, 11.2 % Latino/Hispanic [the most common racial/ethnic groups in the schools where data collection took place]) in two tasks: peer inclusion and attribution of ability. On the peer inclusion task, participants were more likely to choose a non-White peer for a STEM activity if they had lower perceptions of stereotyping at school, and they were more likely to choose a female peer if they were female. Participants were more likely to use reasoning based on personal characteristics when choosing a peer, but female participants who chose a female peer were more likely to use reasoning based on gender. On the attribution task, participants were more likely to choose a non-White peer if they perceived greater STEM connectedness, and they were more likely to choose a White or male peer if they had more positive relationships with their STEM teachers. Therefore, stu-dents' perceptions of school racial climate relate to adolescents' peer inclusion decisions, and their perceptions of STEM classroom climate relate to adolescents' ability attributions. Schools may need to focus on creating welcoming school and classroom envi-ronments as a way to promote equity in STEM.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cogent indicated prevention with young children at risk for early onset conduct problems needs to address multiple domains of influence in school and home settings. A multicontextual preventive intervention (MPI) spanning grades one and two was conducted in schools serving economically disadvantaged communities and evaluated separately for boys and girls. The cluster randomized design evaluated children nested within schools receiving either the MPI (6 schools), which consisted of after-school reading-mentoring, home-based family, peer coping-skills, and classroom components, or a control condition (6 schools) involving a school-wide conflict management program without targeted intervention. Drawn at the end of kindergarten based on elevated behavioral difficulties and first-grade attendance at one of the 12 schools, the two subsamples consisted of 193 boys and 171 girls (63% in households with annual income < $15,000; 95% Black children). Extensive fidelity data indicated that the MPI components were well implemented. The two post-intervention third-grade outcomes in this report are academic performance and social/behavioral adjustment. The analyses involved a linear mixed effects model controlling for school. The key finding for the male subsample was that the MPI produced greater overall and language-arts/reading achievement, measured by report cards for the entire third-grade school year, compared with the control group. MPI-control differences did not emerge for externalizing problems and social competence assessed via teacher and parent report. In the face of elevated risk and poverty, the study underscored the importance of contributions from community-based reading-mentors, positive and inclusive classrooms, and nurturing family contexts in achieving academic gains.

AB Commonsense understandings of school practices have historically painted parents of color as inattentive and non-participatory actors in public school settings. Racist implementations of policy and individual actions, based on teacher ideology and deficit paradigms of race, force parents of color to take an oppositional stance in public school settings. The commonsense notion of good parenting is countered by descriptions of how parents of color, particularly mothers, remain involved and active leaders in the lives of their children by pursuing schooling options and opposing enactments of school policies and practices that further marginalize their children. Using data from two studies in different countries, the authors explore how women of color enact racial justice by advocating for their children and preparing them to face racism in public school settings.

TI Are Achievement Gap Estimates Biased by Differential Student Test
   Effort? Putting an Important Policy Metric to the Test
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID RAPID-GUESSING BEHAVIOR; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER;
   MATHEMATICS; ELEMENTARY; MOTIVATION; TRENDS
AB Background/Context: Achievement gaps motivate a range of practices and policies aimed at closing those gaps. Most gaps studies assume that differences in observed test scores across subgroups are measuring differences in content mastery. For such an assumption to hold, students in the subgroups being compared need to be giving similar effort on the test. Studies already show that low test effort is prevalent and biases observed test scores downward. What research does not demonstrate is whether test effort differs by subgroup and, therefore, biases estimates of achievement gaps.
   Purpose: This study examines whether test effort differs by student subgroup,including by race and gender. The sensitivity of achievement gap estimates to any differences in test effort is also considered.
   Research Design: A behavioral proxy for test effort called "rapid guessing" was used. Rapid guessing occurs when students answer a test item so fast, they could not have understood its content. Rates of rapid guessing were compared across subgroups. Then, achievement gaps were estimated unconditional and conditional on measures of rapid guessing.
   Findings: Test effort differs substantially by subgroup, with males rapidly guessing nearly twice as often as females in later grades, and Black students rapidly guessing more often than White students. However, these differences in rapid guessing generally do not impact substantive interpretations of achievement gaps, though basic conclusions about male-female gaps and changes in gaps as students progress through school may change when models account for test effort.
   Conclusions: Although the bias introduced into achievement gap estimates by differential test effort is hard to quantify, results provide an important reminder that test scores reflect achievement only to the extent that students are willing and able to demonstrate what they have learned. Understanding why there are subgroup differences in test effort would likely be useful to educators and is worthy of additional study.

AB This study examined behavioral indicators (measured by multiple informants) of young urban children's exposure to community violence during middle school. The community-based school sample included 549 students (53% male; 86.8% African American, 13.2% Euro American). First-grade aggressive behavior and anxiety symptoms were examined as predictors of later victimization and witnessing of community violence. Logistic regression analyses indicated that girls' first-grade aggression significantly predicted witnessing violence in middle school, regardless of informant. Parent-reported child aggression significantly predicted boys' later victimization. Teacher- and parent-reported child aggression was associated with witnessing more community violence among boys with low self-reported anxiety. Anxiety attenuated the relationship between aggression and witnessing community violence during adolescence for boys. The importance of the identifying early predictors of later community violence exposure in designing preventive interventions is discussed. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This qualitative study used Critical Race Theory as a theoretical framework to examine the meaning, context, and process by which 12 African American students in gifted education programs formulated perceptions of their experiences in those programs. The following themes emerged from the semistructured, biographical questionnaires and individual interviews: (a) critical issues facing gifted African American students; (b) ways that the students navigate the perils of gifted education; and (c) the benefits of gifted education. These themes highlight the salience of race inside and outside gifted education programs. The research findings also provide practical applications for teachers, principals, school counselors, and parents.

AB Objectives: To determine the prevalence of medical use of 4 classes of prescription medications relative to nonmedical use ( illicit use), to examine the relative rates among the 4 drug classes, and to assess whether gender differences exist in the trading, selling, loaning, or giving away of medications.
   Design: A Web- based survey was administered to 7th-to 12th- grade students residing in 1 ethnically diverse school district; a 68% response rate was achieved.
   Setting: During a 3- week period in May 2005, teachers brought students to their schools' computing center where students took the survey using a unique personal identification number to sign on to the survey.
   Participants: There were 1086 secondary students, including 586 girls, 498 boys, 484 black students, and 565 white students.
   Main Outcome Measures: Students were asked about their medical and nonmedical use of sleeping, sedative or anxiety, stimulant, and pain medications. Diversion of prescription medication was assessed by determining who asked the student to divert his or her prescription and who received it.
   Results: Thirty- six percent of students reported having a recent prescription for 1 of the 4 drug classes. A higher percentage of girls reported giving away their medications than boys ( 27.5% vs 17.4%, respectively; chi(2)(1) = 6.7; P =. 01); girls were significantly more likely than boys to divert to female friends ( 64.0% vs 21.2%, respectively; chi(2)(1)= 17.5; P < .001) whereas boys were more likely than girls to divert to male friends ( 45.5% vs 25.6%, respectively; chi(2)(1) = 4.4; P = .04). Ten percent diverted their drugs to parents.
   Conclusion: Physicians should discuss the proper use of prescription medications with their patients and their patients' families.

AB Few studies have considered life course predictors of religiosity. We use the Woodlawn Study of a cohort of 1242 first-grade African American children followed over four time periods to age 42 to observe how early school behaviors, family characteristics and neighborhood and social resources relate to later religiosity. Past literature suggested several domains of religiosity and exploratory factor analyses supported four measures of religiosity: religiosity as a resource, youth religiosity, divine struggle, and young adult religiosity. In multivariate analyses, males rated by teachers as shy in first grade, those with more than a high school education, and females who reported higher social ties in young adulthood were more likely to report religiosity as a resource at age 42. Males with both shy and aggressive behavior in first grade and females with lower math grades in first grade reported more youth religiosity. Those who obtained more education were less likely to report divine struggle. In terms of religiosity as a young adult, females who had been rated as both shy and aggressive in first grade, those living in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of African Americans, those with higher social ties in young adulthood and those living in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of African Americans reported higher adult religiosity. Longitudinal studies offer an opportunity to examine how patterns of religiosity vary over the life course and how early family, school, and social adaptation influence later religiosity in adulthood.

AB IMPORTANCE Home visiting programs targeting the school readiness of preschool children (age range, 4-5 years) show promise in short-term and quasi-experimental studies but rarely are evaluated with rigorous designs and follow-up assessments.
   OBJECTIVES To examine the sustained effects of a preschool home visiting program on child and family competencies and on child need for services 4 years later.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a randomized clinical trial, individual families with preschool children were assigned to receive the Research-Based and Developmentally Informed-Parent home visiting program (REDI-P) (intervention group) or math home learning games in the mail (control group). Follow-up assessments occurred in third grade. Families were recruited from 24 Head Start centers in 3 Pennsylvania counties serving rural and urban areas. Four-year-old children from 200 low-income families participated. Families were recruited in fall 2008 and fall 2009. The follow-up data used were collected in spring 2013 and spring 2014. The analyses were conducted in 2016 to 2017.
   INTERVENTIONS REDI-P visits followed a well-specified curriculum, with 10 home visits during preschool and 6 booster visits in kindergarten. Parents received coaching to enhance parent-child relationships and home learning materials to support child development and school readiness.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Intervention focused on boosting competencies in academic performance and social-emotional adjustment and reducing child problems at home. Direct assessments, teacher ratings, and parent reports were collected. In addition, third-grade teachers recorded all services that children needed and received at school.
   RESULTS Two hundred participating children (110 [55.0%] white, 52 [26.0%] black, and 38 [19.0%] Latino; 112 [56.0%] male) had a mean (SD) age of 4.45 (0.29) years at the start of intervention. Third-grade outcomes were available for 153 (763%) of the initial sample and revealed statistically significant effects on multiple measures in each competency domain. In addition, REDI-P reduced child need for educational and mental health services at school. Significant effect sizes were small to moderate, averaging approximately one-third of 1SD (Cohen d = 0.27 to 0.45). Mediation models demonstrated that intervention effects on services were accounted for by intervention effects on the targeted competencies.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE REDI-P produced sustained benefits evident 4 years after intervention, significantly reducing child need for school services. The results of this study appear to validate the value of preschool home visiting as a strategy to help close the gap in school readiness and child well-being associated with poverty.

AB The opportunity gap, or conditions and barriers that impede the academic performance and school experience of minoritized students, may be exacerbated by educators' implicit biases. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand preservice educators' awareness of individual, structural, and systemic racism with regard to implicit bias. Our sample included 154 preservice educators, enrolled in an anti-bullying/harassment/discrimination training, which is required for any New York State (NYS) educator certification. Educators responded to questions about group generalizations, factors contributing to these biases, and how biases may affect their behavior toward students. Our content analysis revealed several themes, most notably that frequent biases existed toward Asian/Asian Americans, Black/African Americans, males, and people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Although participant responses reflect an open-minded approach to discussing bias, many responses reflected no observable desire to change potentially biased interactions with students. Responses with racially held biases aligned with the tenets of critical race theory (CRT), particularly racism as permanent and racism as normalized. Implications for practice, with an emphasis on anti-bias training and professional development, are discussed.

TI Transforming fear into rigor, love, freedom, and joy: A new paradigm of

AB In the liberatory spirit of Black scholars and honoring the pioneering work of motivation theorists dedicated to a democratic vision of education, this article calls for a new paradigm of standards-based reform. Specifically, we maintain that current standards largely reflect the interests of White, male elites and elevates the economic agenda above other important purposes of education. Moreover, we argue that the standards movement aims to motivate educators to improve the quality of teaching primarily through rewards or fear of public shaming-an approach that is unlikely to lead to a transformation of the system toward racial equity, lifelong learning, wellness, and citizenship. We call for a reframing of educational standards to also include outcomes that nurture and honor the whole human experience-a North Star rooted in the outcomes of rigor, love, freedom, and joy that can serve as a beacon for transforming education toward humanistic outcomes in a racially-divided world. This article is organized into three main sections. First, a historical review of standards-based reform movement is provided followed by an overview of the empirical research underlying the proposed North Star. Finally, we conclude with implications of this new paradigm for research, practice, and advocacy.

AB The present study examined longitudinal associations between preschoolers' executive function (EF) and adult educational attainment, impulse control, and general health directly and through its cascading effects on childhood and adolescent EF using a large, national, and prospective longitudinal sample of participants. Data were drawn from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD SECCYD) and included a diverse sample (52% male at birth; 76% White; 13% Black; 6% Hispanic; and 5% other; 14.23 mean years of maternal education) of 1,364 participants born in 1991 and followed through age 26. Four main findings emerged. First, we observed significant bivariate relations between EF measured at 54 months and adult educational attainment (r = .36, p < .01), and impulse control (r = .11, p = .01). Second, early EF measured during preschool and childhood explained variance in adult educational attainment and impulse control above and beyond adolescent EF. Third, childhood EF mediated the association between preschool EF and adult educational attainment and impulse control but did not operate through adolescent EF. Finally, neither preschool EF nor EF measured at other developmental stages predicted health during adulthood. Together, these findings shed light on the direct and cascading influences of EF across development on important domains of adult functioning.

AB Despite the critical importance of attention for children's self-regulation and mental health, there are few task-based measures of this construct appropriate for use across a wide childhood age range including very young children. Three versions of a combined go/no-go and continuous performance task (GNG/CPT) were created with varying length and timing parameters to maximize their appropriateness for age groups spanning early to middle childhood. As part of the baseline assessment of a clinical trial, 452 children aged 3-12 years (50% male, 50% female; 52% White, non-Hispanic, 27% Black, 16% Hispanic/Latinx; 6% other ethnicity/race) completed the task. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that all task versions assessed two latent factors, labeled response inhibition and sustained attention. Versions for older children elicited lower overall accuracy while equating levels of inhibitory demand. All versions showed limited floor and ceiling effects, as well as developmental sensitivity. Boys showed higher commission error rates and children from lower income households showed lower performance across multiple task metrics. Task metrics, especially d prime and accuracy summary scores, correlated with parent-reported executive function and externalizing behavior. Task scores show promise as valid and sensitive indicators of inhibition and sustained attention across heterogeneous pediatric age groups.

AB Purpose: To examine whether generation of 'socially appropriate' responses or divergent responses to continued peer pressure is a more effective deterrent of actual delinquency.
   Methods: The sample of 129 urban adolescents included both boys and girls (51.9% male) and was predominantly black (48.%) and Hispanic (28.7%). They were studied longitudinally from seventh to eighth grade in New York City from 2000-2001. Resistance strategies to offers to smoke and to shoplift were assessed in two separate videotaped role-plays. Socially appropriate responses were defined as assertive and nonaggressive, including the use of a simple no; direct, declarative statements; and offering prosocial alternatives. Divergent responses were defined as multiple unique response types within the same situation regardless of appropriateness. Data were analyzed using hierarchical logistic regressions.
   Results: High use of divergent responses was consistently associated favorably with changes in delinquency from seventh to eighth grade. High use of divergent responses was associated with lowered likelihood to vandalize, steal or shoplift, and commit multiple acts of any type of delinquency, even after controlling for seventh grade delinquency. Socially appropriate responses showed little association to any delinquent behavior.
   Conclusions: Different social pressure situations and contexts may require different responses. As trying to teach effective responses for every single potential peer pressure situation would be impossible, promoting divergent thinking may be an attractive alternative.

AB Importance Life expectancy is decreasing in the US. Without national efforts to address factors that support policies and programs directed at children living in areas of concentrated poverty, life expectancy will likely continue to decline while costs and suffering associated with unnatural deaths will increase. Objective To identify which childhood factors are associated with death from unnatural causes through midadulthood. Design, Setting, and Participants For this cohort study, longitudinal data on childhood characteristics came from a group-randomized intervention trial implemented in Baltimore City Public Schools, Baltimore, Maryland (baseline 1985-1986; all students entering first grade were selected to participate at age 6 years). Participants were followed up to midadulthood with a National Death Index search through December 31, 2020. Data analysis was performed from February to May 2023. Exposures Exposures included individual factors (ie, sociodemographic characteristics, teacher-reported aggressive behavior, self-reported depression, anxiety, early alcohol and cannabis use, and assaultive violence exposure), family and peer factors (ie, household structure and education level, deviant peer affiliation, and parental monitoring), and neighborhood factors (ie, rates of neighborhood assault and public assistance). Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was unnatural death, defined as death due to unintentional injury, suicide, and homicide. A National Death Index search ascertained participants who died by age 41 to 42 years and cause of death. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify whether the exposures were independently associated with future mortality by unnatural causes. Results The initial trial included 2311 children, and longitudinal data were available for 2180 participants (median [IQR] age in first grade, 6.3 [6.0-6.5] years; 1090 female [50.0%]; 1461 Black [67.0%]; 1168 received free or reduced lunch in first grade [53.6%]). A total of 111 male participants (10.2%) and 29 female participants (2.7%) died; among those who died, 96 male participants (86.5%) and 14 female participants (48.3%) died of unnatural causes. Two factors remained significantly associated with mortality from unnatural causes: female sex was associated with reduced risk (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.22), and neighborhood public assistance was associated with increased risk (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.09-3.30). Conclusions and Relevance In this urban population-based cohort study, no modifiable risk factors of mortality at the level of the individual (eg, depression or anxiety and substance use) or the family (eg, household education level) were identified. However, the degree of neighborhood poverty in early childhood was significantly associated with death by unnatural causes in early adulthood, suggesting that economic policies are needed to advance health equity in relation to premature mortality.

TI A Single Voice in the Crowd: A Case Study of One Student's Determination
   to Challenge Top Down School Reform
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD

DT Article
ID NO CHILD LEFT; SELF-DETERMINATION; EDUCATION; MOTIVATION; LEADERSHIP;
   CLOSURE
AB Background: Set against the backdrop of accountability reform and the dire consequences imposed upon "failing" schools, this study focuses on the advocacy of one student leader determined to resist the political direction to close his school. While a few studies have documented student voice in reform resistance, none have documented the voice of a student with a dis/ability.
   Objective: Using a theoretical framework that weaves together self-determination theory and resiliency theory, the study seeks to understand the motivation and the conditions for that motivation driving a student to take action and the potential role of young people in current educational reform.
   Setting: The study takes place in a large, urban city in central Texas. The high school slated for closure is in a poor, minority neighborhood and has been the subject of various reform efforts over the last two decades.
   Population: As a single case study, the sole subject is EJ, a young black male with a dis/ability. EJ is the president of his student body and a leader in the reform resistance for his school.
   Research Design: This case study is qualitative and uses narrative inquiry to document the story of EJ over a two-year period, following his initial involvement in reform resistance at his school to his key role as student body president during a volatile year of reform decisions by his school district.
   Data Collection and Analysis: The study relies on data collected as part of a larger study examining the impact of school turnaround efforts on students with dis/abilities. Centering on the personal accounts of EJ and his own description of what occurred at his school and his leadership role, his narrative in analyzed through the theoretical lens of self-determination and resiliency theory. Data from the larger study is used to triangulate EJ's account.
   Findings: The study finds that students, and particularly students historically marginalized in school settings, can be extremely effective voices for change.
   Conclusions: The paper concludes with implications for accountability reform and a discussion of the potential of expanding approaches of student engagement in reform efforts to include student voice, particularly, the voices of students with dis/abilities.

SO FUTURE OF CHILDREN

AB Beginning as early as preschool, race and gender are intertwined with the way US schools mete out discipline. In particular, black students and male students are much more likely than others to be suspended or expelled-punishments that we know can hold them back academically. These disparities, and the damage they can cause, have driven recent reforms, including some that incorporate social and emotional learning (SEL) practices.
   Anne Gregory and Edward Fergus review federal and state mandates to cut down on punishments that remove students from school, and they show how some districts are embracing SEL in their efforts to do so. Yet even in these districts, large disparities in discipline persist. The authors suggest two reasons current discipline reforms that embrace SEL practices may hold limited promise for reducing discipline disparities.
   The first is that prevailing "colorblind" notions of SEL don't consider power, privilege, and cultural difference-thus ignoring how individual beliefs and structural biases can lead educators to react harshly to behaviors that fall outside a white cultural frame of reference. The second is that most SEL models are centered on students, but not on the adults who interact with them. Yet research shows that educators' own social and emotional competencies strongly influence students' motivation to learn and the school climate in general.
   Gregory and Fergus describe how one school district is striving to orient its discipline policies around a conception of SEL that stresses equity and promotes both adults' and students' SEL competencies. Although such reforms hold promise, they are still in the early stages, and the authors call for rigorous empirical work to test whether such efforts can substantially reduce or eradicate racial and gender disparities in discipline.

TI Overweight and hyperinsulinemia provide individual contributions to
   compromises in brachial artery distensibility in healthy adolescents and
   young adults
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION
LA English
DT Article
DE Elasticity; obesity; insulin; pediatrics
AB Brachial artery distensibility (BrachD) was measured in healthy children to identify associations with atherosclerotic risk factors. Nine hundred sixty-nine black and white subjects, 13-22 years of age, were classified as lean (L) or overweight (O) and as hyperinsulinemic (H-I) or normoinsulinemic (N-I). Blood pressure (BP) and BrachD were obtained with a DynaPulse Pathway instrument. Analysis of variance was performed, looking for group mean differences. Correlations between BrachD and risk variables were examined. Determinates of BrachD were determined by backward elimination regression, stratified by body mass index (BMI)-insulin group. Decreased BrachD correlated with male gender, O, higher BP, heart rate, fasting glucose, and log of fasting insulin after adjusting for pulse pressure (PP). BrachD was greatest in L + N-I, with progressive decreases seen in L + H-I, O + N-I, and O + H-I subjects. Regression modeling found that PP and HR were major determinates of BrachD. Glucose was significant for subjects with N-I, regardless of adiposity. Excluding BP, glucose remained important in N-I subjects. Gender was significant for all. HR retained significance only in O subjects, regardless of insulin level. In healthy adolescents, hyperinsulinemia and obesity adversely affect brachial artery function, with overweight contributing to a greater degree. In normoinsulinemic subjects, fasting glucose was inversely related to BrachD. Metabolic factors may play a role in vascular function in youth. (C) 2007 American Society of Hypertension.

TI I wanna hold your hand: The progression of social, romantic and sexual
   events in adolescent relationships
SO PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN; BEHAVIORS; GIRLS
AB CONTEXT: Despite the vast amount of existing research on adolescent sexual behavior, little is known about the trajectory of social, romantic and sexual events within an adolescent's relationship.
   METHODS: A subsample of participants in Wave 2 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (8,438 respondents aged 12-21) provided data on the sequence of 15 social, romantic and sexual events that occurred in a recent romantic relationship. Proportions reporting each event and average relative rankings were assessed for all respondents, for different racial and ethnic groups, and for respondents who belonged to the same racial or ethnic group as their partner. Logistic regression was used to compare proportions; ordinary least square regression was used to analyze the mean sequential ranking of each event.
   RESULTS: Social and romantic events, such as spending time with one's partner in a group and holding hands, were far more common than sexual events, such as touching one's partner without clothing, and typically preceded sexual events in the trajectory of relationship events. Romantic events were the most common across three of the four major U.S. racial and ethnic groups. Asian and Hispanic respondents tended to have low proportions reporting sexual events compared with white respondents. Black adolescents were the only group for whom talking about prevention of pregnancy and STDs preceded sexual events. Reports from male and female adolescents were similar.
   CONCLUSION: Recognition of the diversity of relationship experiences may prompt the development of more effective interventions for adolescents who engage in risky sexual behavior.

AB Educators have become increasingly committed to social and emotional learning in schools. However, we know too little about the typical growth trajectories of the competencies that schools are striving to improve. We leverage data from the California Office to Reform Education, a consortium of districts in California serving over 1.5 million students, that administers annual surveys to students to measure social and emotional competencies (SECs). This article uses data from six cohorts of approximately 16,000 students each (51% male, 73% Latinx, 11% White, 10% Black, 24% with parents who did not complete high school) in Grades 4-12. Two questions are addressed. First, how much growth occurs in growth mindset, self-efficacy, self-management, and social awareness from Grades 4 to 12? Second, do initial status and growth look different by parental educational attainment and gender? Using accelerated longitudinal design growth models, findings show distinct growth trends among the four SECs with growth mindset increasing, self-management mostly decreasing, and self-efficacy and social awareness decreasing and then increasing. The subgroup analyses show gaps between groups but patterns of growth that are more similar than different. Further, subgroup membership accounts for very little variation in growth or declines. Instead, initial levels of competencies predict growth. Also, variation within groups is greater than variation between groups. The findings have practical implications for educators and psychologists striving to improve SECs. If schools use student-report approaches, predicting steady and consistent positive growth in SECs is unrealistic. Instead, U-shaped patterns for some SECs appear to be normative with notable declines in the sixth grade, requiring new supports.

AB This mixed methods study reports data from the implementation of a 2-week nanotechnology camp for secondary level students. The camp, Nanotechnology Experiences for Students and Teachers, had the overarching goal of increasing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) interest among the next generation of potential STEM professionals. Statistical pre- and postsurvey data indicate that overall the camp was successful in fostering increased STEM interest among participants. However, early analysis of ethnographic data showed that African American students were observed to have radically different experiences than the non-African American students. To better understand why the camp yielded such divergent outcomes, we examined ethnographic data focusing specifically on incidents of microaggressions. We were particularly interested in the impact that microaggressions had on African American students' camp experience and learning. Our data show that microaggressions were pervasive; they came from students, instructors, and the environment; and in response, African American students adopted detachment-coping strategies. Together these factors worked against African American students' success. We conclude with suggestions for practice.

AB A series of articles is devoted to the study of the education system in the Kutaisi province of the Russian Empire in the period from 1846 to 1917. This article examines the period from 1885 to 1900.
   As the main source, the authors used the annual "Reports of the trustee of the Caucasian educational district on the state of educational institutions" of the Ministry of Public Education for 1885-1900. The methodological basis of the research is both special historical methods (historical-comparative, historical-system, historical-statistical (quantitative/mathematical), and general scientific methods (synthesis, analysis, generalization, classification and categorization).
   Besides the dynamics of quantitative indicators for students, the paper analyzes statistics on such criteria as the ratio of students in male and female gymnasiums and progymnasiums by national composition, confessional, class and gender characteristics (the last criterion is only for applicants for secondary education); to study objectively the dynamics the "cross-sections" are taken at three points of the chronological period indicated by us: 1885 (lower), 1893 (middle) and 1900 (upper). The article also analyzes the dynamics of the number of secondary (gymnasiums, progymnasiums, real schools, teachers 'seminaries, etc.), lower (urban and craft/industrial schools, mountain schools, nautical classes) and primary (state/public urban/rural schools) educational institutions.
   According to the results of the study, the authors draw conclusions about the dynamics of the development of education in the designated years; in particular, the number of students in secondary and lower educational institutions increased almost 2,5 times, primary - 3 times, with the largest percentage of growth falling on female students. The total number of educational institutions has increased almost 2 times.

AB This article is the second part in a series of works devoted to the analysis of the development of the education system in 1849-1917 in the Erivan province of the Russian Empire, and explores the period of 1885-1907. On the example of statistical data, the activity of secondary (gymnasium, progymnasium, teacher's seminary), lower (city schools) and primary (primary schools) educational institutions is considered; on the basis of these data, the conclusions are drawn about the peculiarities of the development of the education system in the Erivan province in the period from 1885 to 1907.
   The main source of this article is the reports of the trustees of the Caucasian Educational District, which contain detailed the statistical material on the work of all types of educational institutions.
   As the analysis of these materials showed, in general, the education system at the turn of the century in the Erivan province was developing very actively. This applies in particular to women's education: in secondary educational institutions, the number of female students exceeded the number of male students by almost one and a half times, which is unusual for the Caucasian regions; in the field of lower education during the study period (1885-1907) increased more than twice, in the field of primary education - ten and a half times. The growth of educational institutions was also relevant.
   Unlike other regions, the unprivileged classes - peasants and workers - were widely represented in education.
   Also, the development of the education system in the Erivan province in the specified chronological period was distinguished by a very strong volatility in the number of students, which practically did not correlate with the population of the region.

AB IMPORTANCE Stress and viral illness during pregnancy are associated with neurodevelopmental conditions in offspring. Autism screening positivity for children born during the pandemic remains unknown. OBJECTIVE To examine associations between prenatal exposure to the pandemic milieu and maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with rates of positive Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R) screenings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data for this cohort study were drawn from the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) Initiative. M-CHAT-R scores obtained from children aged 16 to 30 months during routine clinical care at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City were abstracted from electronic health records (EHRs) for children born between January 2018 and September 2021 (COMBO-EHR cohort). Separately, the M-CHAT-R was administered at 18 months for children born between February 2020 and September 2021 through a prospective longitudinal study (COMBORSCH cohort). Prenatal pandemic exposure (birth after March 1, 2020) and maternal SARS-CoV-2 status during pregnancy was determined through EHRs. Data were analyzed from March 2022 to June 2024. EXPOSURES Prenatal exposures to the pandemic milieu and maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was rate of positive M-CHAT-R screenings. For all primary analyses, unadjusted chi 2 2 tests and adjusted logistic regression models were performed. RESULTS The COMBO-EHR cohort included 1664 children (442 born before the pandemic and 1222 born during the pandemic; 997 SARS-CoV-2 unexposed, 130 SARS-CoV-2 exposed, and 95 with unknown SARS-CoV-2 exposure status), of whom 266 (16.0%) were Black, 991 (59.6%) were Hispanic, 400 (24.0%) were White, 1245 (74.8%) were insured through Medicaid, 880 (52.9%) were male, and 204 (12.3%) were born prematurely. The COMBO-RSCH cohort included 385 children (74 born before the pandemic and 311 born during the pandemic; 201 SARS-CoV-2 unexposed, 101 SARS-CoV-2 exposed, and 9 with unknown SARS-CoV-2 exposure status), of whom 39(10.1%) were Black, 168 (43.6%) were Hispanic, 157 (40.8%) were White, 161 (41.8%) were insured through Medicaid, 222 (57.7%) were male, and 38(9.9%) were born prematurely. Prenatal pandemic exposure was not associated with a higher positive M-CHAT-R screening rate in either the COMBO-EHR or COMBO-RSCH cohort. Prenatal exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a lower rate of M-CHAT-R positivity in the COMBO-EHR cohort (12.3% [16 children] vs 24.0% [239 children]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.68; P = .001), but no association was found in the COMBO-RSCH cohort (12.9% [13 children] vs 19.9% [40 children]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.24-1.04; P = .07). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study of 2 groups of children with prenatal pandemic exposure and/or exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, neither exposure was associated with greater M-CHAT-R positivity.

TI The Problem With Screen Time
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Since 1999, a "two hours a day" restriction has been recommended for screen time for children, yet American households continue to consume far more media than such recommendations allow. At the basis of such largely ignored admonitions is a dosage model of technology in which a presumed homogeneous substance called "screen time" is the intervention and changes in some set of continuous and measurable variables (e.g., literacy, aggression, social acuity, BMI) are the outcomes. However, to treat "screen time" as a meaningful unit of analysis is to carve the world at the wrong ontological joints. If we want to make claims about what is and is not good for children and counsel parents on how to regulate, mediate, and participate in media use in the home, we need to understand the black box of screen time and unpack how technology is used in specific ways in specific material and social contexts, and the relationship of that activity to systems of meaning beyond the device or screen.
   Purpose: In this article, we unpack the notion of screen time as a way to problematize the dosage model of media use and the regulatory admonitions given parents based on it.
   Research Design: In this investigation, we use Stake's instrumental case study methods to examine in detail a single child's activity in the videogame Madden; the meaning, function and context of this play; and how it is tied to other forms of engagement and the activity of American football. "Madden" is our bounded case, but, as we will show, the meaning of playing Madden comes from its location within the broader activity of "American football."
   Data Collection and Analysis: Observations of the 7-year-old male's gameplay and attending activities for a period of 3.5 months, with multiple informal interviews about his activity across that observational period, including a 90-minute structured interview midway through observations. Field notes and screenshots were taken on both informal and formal observations.
   Findings: This case study illustrates how digital games, streamed and live video, print documents, tangible manipulatives, and physical action are caught up in a single coherent transmedia endeavor whose means and instruments are constructed first, perhaps, by media producers but then deconstructed and repurposed by users themselves. The videogame as practiced is a simulated system tied to the real world it represents, and, as such, play is deeply embedded in a complex semiotic, material, and social context.
   Conclusions: Constructs such as screen time quantity distract us from other, more explanatory constructs such as productive practice, critical consumption, developmental progressions, and intertextuality.

TI How Large an Effect Can We Expect from School Reforms?
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID NATIONAL ASSESSMENT; MODEL
AB Background/Context: Determining the effectiveness of reform strategies is a major part of the current and future educational research agenda. Effects of education reforms will be evaluated largely quantitatively, and an important aspect of this work will be judging how well reform strategies work. The rhetoric of contemporary school reform suggests two somewhat different solutions to the problem of the interpretive frame. One solution is derived from the idea that the goal of school reform is to reduce the achievement gaps between minority groups such as Blacks or Hispanics and Whites, rich and poor, and males and females. The second solution is derived from a similar idea that school reforms are intended to reduce the achievement gap between lower and higher achieving schools.
   Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore these two alternative frameworks for interpreting the effects of school reforms and to gain insight about the implications of each of the frameworks for interpreting these effects.
   Research Design: We use NAEP trend data and examine empirical evidence about the implications of these two frameworks for judging the effects of school reforms. Our study is correlational and uses observational data from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.
   Findings: We find that these two frameworks lead to different judgments about whether the effects of reforms are large enough to be important. We argue that the normative distribution of school effects framework is more appropriate than the other framework for interpreting the likely magnitude of school reform effects. In addition, we show that interpreting the magnitude of the effects of school reforms in terms of individual variation and the achievement gaps between important student groups may not only be disappointing, but also misleading.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: The results of this study can be used to provide a way to obtain plausible reform effects for designing studies of school reform. The results of this study can also provide a context in which to evaluate the results of studies of the effectiveness of school reform in terms of national data. Our study also illustrates one way in which survey data can contribute to evidence-based policy formation. The distribution of the observed school effects provides a basis for estimating plausible effect magnitudes for planning intervention studies. The analyses of school effects can also provide a context for interpreting treatment effects within the context of the observed variation. It permits the policy researcher to explain the implications of reform effects within the backdrop of observed variation within which any intervention will operate.

AB Background Adiposity status in adolescence is associated with various health outcomes in adulthood. Waist circumference [WC] and waist-to-height ratio [WHtR] are measures of abdominal obesity and have shown to be valid predictors of future chronic diseases. However, the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and WC, as well as WHtR in U.S. adolescents remain unclear. Thus, the study aims to examine associations between sociodemographic characteristics and abdominal obesity among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents. Methods The sample included 4712 adolescents (12-19 years) in the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Associations between sociodemographic characteristics and abdominal obesity (WC and WHtR) were examined using multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for age, physical activity level, and sedentary activity. Results Around 18% of adolescents had high-risk WC (>= 90th percentile) and 34% had high-risk WHtR (>= 0.5). Females had higher odds of high-risk WHtR compared to males (OR = 1.46, 95%CI = 1.23-1.72). Mexican American adolescents had higher odds of high-risk WHtR compared to non-Hispanic White (OR = 1.66, 95%CI = 1.24-2.20), non-Hispanic Black (OR = 1.73, 95%CI = 1.26-2.36), and other race/multi-racial adolescents (OR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.21-2.80). When their parent were college graduates, adolescents had lower odds for high-risk WC compared to when the parent had some college education (OR = 0.68, 95%CI = 0.49-0.93) or a high school degree or less (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.51-0.97). Similar associations were seen between parental education level and high-risk WHtR, as well as between household income and high-risk WHtR. Conclusions Measures of abdominal obesity should be considered to assess burden of adiposity, especially among female adolescents, adolescents from racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status backgrounds. Additionally, future health interventions should consider including changes in WC and WHtR to measure the impact of these interventions.

AB The author shares an opportunity gap explanatory framework to assist educational researchers and theorists in analyzing, explaining, and naming educational practice, especially in highly diverse and urban social contexts. The author argues that too much attention is placed on achievement gaps and challenges researchers and theorists to expand their analyses to opportunity gaps. Focusing on opportunity allows researchers to examine the causes of disparities that exist between and among students in schools. Emerging from the author's own research and from an established body of theory and research, the framework encompasses five interrelated tenets essential to understanding and explaining educational practice related to opportunity: color blindness, cultural conflicts, meritocracy, deficit mindsets and low expectations, and context-neutral mindsets and practices. Implications of the framework point to potential synergy in language and research emphases that can shed light in the educational literature on deeply inequitable systems, processes, structures, policies, and practices that can prevent some students from reaching their full capacity.

AB Importance Adverse childhood experiences are pervasive and heterogeneous, with potential lifelong consequences for psychiatric morbidity and brain health. Existing research does not capture the complex interplay of multiple adversities, resulting in a lack of precision in understanding their associations with neural function and mental health. Objectives To identify distinct childhood adversity profiles and examine their associations with adolescent mental health and brain connectivity. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based birth cohort used data for children who were born in 20 large US cities between 1998 and 2000 and participated in the Future Families and Child Well-Being Study. Families were interviewed when children were born and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15 years. At age 15 years, neuroimaging data were collected from a subset of these youths. Data were collected from February 1998 to April 2017. Analyses were conducted from March to December 2023. Exposures Latent profiles of childhood adversity, defined by family and neighborhood risks across ages 0 to 9 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 15 years using parent- and youth-reported measures. Profile-specific functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity across the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and frontoparietal network (FPN). Results Data from 4210 individuals (2211 [52.5%] male; 1959 [46.5%] Black, 1169 [27.7%] Hispanic, and 786 [18.7%] White) revealed 4 childhood adversity profiles: low-adversity (1230 individuals [29.2%]), medium-adversity (1973 [46.9%]), high-adversity (457 [10.9%]), and high maternal depression (MD; 550 [13.1%]). High-adversity, followed by MD, profiles had the highest symptoms. Notably, internalizing symptoms did not differ between these 2 profiles (mean difference, 0.11; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.26), despite the MD profile showing adversity levels most similar to the medium-adversity profile. In the neuroimaging subsample of 167 individuals (91 [54.5%] female; 128 [76.6%] Black, 11 [6.6%] Hispanic, and 20 [12.0%] White; mean [SD] age, 15.9 [0.5] years), high-adversity and MD profiles had the highest DMN density relative to other profiles (F-(3,F-163) = 11.14; P < .001). The high-adversity profile had lower SN density relative to the low-adversity profile (mean difference, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and the highest FPN density among all profiles (F-(3,F-163) = 18.96; P < .001). These differences were specific to brain connectivity during an emotion task, but not at rest. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, children who experienced multiple adversities, or only elevated MD, had worse mental health and different neural connectivity in adolescence. Interventions targeting multiple risk factors, with a focus on maternal mental health, could produce the greatest benefits.

AB Objective: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) can improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) but may be physically and emotionally challenging. Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the experience of HCT from the perspective of youth and young adults (YYAs) post-HCT for SCD and their parents. Methods: YYAs were recruited from an urban hospital. Sociodemographic and HCT-specific information was analyzed for all enrolled. YYAs and/or their primary caregivers during HCT, participated in semi-structured interviews (e.g., pre-HCT knowledge, challenges, advice for families/ health care providers). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis. Results: There were 19 YYAs enrolled (63.2% male; 68.4% Black or African American; 47.4% Hispanic or Latino; M days post-HCT = 1946.53 +/- 1329.13; M age at HCT = 10.95 +/- 6.10 years old; M current age 15.74 +/- 5.78 years old). Interviews were done with six YYAs alone, five YYAcaregiver dyads, and eight caregivers alone. The caregivers were all mothers. Participants reported underestimating the emotional impact HCT would have on themselves and their family members. They experienced challenges related to isolation, academics, finances, and post-HCT medical needs. In contrast, they felt well prepared for physiological aspects of HCT. They sought HCT to improve YYAs' HRQOL and encouraged others to consider it, but to be cognizant of the potential psychosocial impact. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of preparing families for the psychosocial effects of HCT. Incorporating psychosocial assessment, education, and intervention throughout HCT has the potential to promote HRQOL for YYAs and their families.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to distinguish roles of demographic variables and bowel segments as predictors of delayed versus early stage colorectal cancer in California.
   METHODS: Demographic and anatomic variables for 66,806 colorectal cancers were extracted from the California Cancer Registry for 2004-2008 and analyzed using logistic regression as delayed versus early stage.
   RESULTS: Odds ratios (OR) for binary stage categories comparing age < 40 (OR = 2.58; 95% CI = 2.26-2.94), 40-49 (1.71; 95% = 1.60-1.83) and 75+ (1.05; 1.02-1.09) relative to 50-74 years were computed. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, ORs for stage categories were: 1.05; 0.99-1.13 (non-Hispanic blacks), 1.08; 1.02-1.13 (Hispanics), and 1.05; 1.00-1.10 (Asian/others). Females had higher odds of delayed diagnosis (1.09; 1.06-1.13) than males. Descending ORs were measured for successively lower to highest socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles (OR 4:5= 1.08; 1.03-1.14, OR 3:5 = 1.13; 1.08 1.19, OR 2:5 = 1.18; 1.12 - 1.24, and OR 1:5 = 1.21; 1.14-1.28).
   CONCLUSIONS: Younger and older than age 50-74; females; Hispanic ethnicity; bowel segment contrasts (right/left, proximal/distal, cecum plus appendix/distal), and lower SES were independent predictors of delayed diagnosis. Low SES was the most robust predictor of delayed diagnosis, independent of other covariates. Approximately 77% of delayed diagnoses were in non-Hispanic whites and Asian/others. These findings illustrate the value of a community SES index for targeting egalitarian colorectal cancer screening. Ann Epidemiol 2011;21:914-921. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data from the Moving to Opportunity Program, a randomized mobility experiment in which a subset of low-income minority families living in public housing in high-poverty neighborhoods were given vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods, were used to evaluate I policy approach for improving children's educational outcomes. Four hundred twenty-five New York City children were seen 21/2 and 5 years following relocation (mean age = 14.64 years, SD = 3.21 years). Analyses examining program effects on 5-year educational outcomes, accounting for 21/2-year outcomes, revealed that program effects on adolescent boys' achievement found at 21/2 years were not sustained at 5 years. Rather, male and female youths 14-20 years of age in low-poverty neighborhoods reported lower school grades and engagement relative to youths in high-poverty neighborhoods. From a policy standpoint, the complexity of enhancing low-income minority children's educational outcomes is underscored by the multiple dynamics involved-family, neighborhood, housing, and school.

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) is a widely researched construct in developmental science, yet less is known concerning relations between SES and adaptive behavior. Specifically, is the relation linear, with higher SES associated with better outcomes, or does the direction of association change at different levels of SES? Our aim was to examine linear ("more is better") and quadratic ("better near the middle") associations between components of SES (i.e., income, years of education, occupational status/prestige) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale), and to explore moderation by developmental period (adolescence, young, middle, and older adulthood), gender/sex (female, male), and race/ethnicity (Asian American, Black, Latinx, multiracial, Native American, White). We hypothesized that there would be more support for a model containing quadratic associations. We conducted a two-stage meta-analytic structural equation model of 60 data sets (27,242 correlations, 498,179 participants) within the United States, accounting for dependencies between correlations, which were identified via the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research and handled using a two-step approach. Income was quadratically associated with depressive symptoms, but the quadratic model did not explain more variance in depressive symptoms than the linear model. Developmental period and race/ethnicity moderated the associations: Income was quadratically associated with depressive symptoms among middle-aged adults, and years of education were quadratically associated with depressive symptoms among White samples. Our findings suggest that researchers and clinical practitioners should consider the elevated risk of depressive symptoms for individuals from low and high-income backgrounds in the United States.
   Public Significance Statement This study suggests that while individuals from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds-indicated by income, years of education, and occupational status/prestige-are at heightened risk for developing depressive symptoms, so too are those from higher income backgrounds. Therefore, clinical practitioners should consider screening for depression among clients from low- and high-income backgrounds, and policymakers should consider the importance of promoting access to the middle class.

TI 'A Highly Selected Strain of Guinea Pigs': The Westinghouse Science
   Talent Search and Educational Meritocracy, 1942-1958
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID 1917 ARMY-ALPHA; ACHIEVEMENT; RESOURCES; INDEXES; BLACK; RACE
AB Overview: This article examines the Westinghouse Science Talent Search over the first sixteen years of its operation. A national contest involving thousands of high school seniors annually, it reflected a growing national concern with developing scientific manpower in the midst of global conflict, the Cold War, and a growing military-industrial complex.
   Background/Context: While there have been recent studies on the historical development of science education, particularly in the mid-twentieth century and immediate postwar era, little attention has been devoted to such extracurricular activities as science fairs and academic contests. This study addresses this gap by examining a prominent national talent search competition, while assessing its place in the development of a meritocratic ethos in science.
   Focus of Study: The study describes the genesis of the Science Talent Search, its approach to identifying winners, and the inequitable impact of this approach. Although the competition's organizers emphasized its meritocratic quality, our analysis demonstrates that the selection process that it employed systematically discriminated against certain groups of students.
   Research Design: The study was conducted by historical research in primary and secondary sources, particularly those associated with the Science Talent Search in the first two decades of its existence. Statistical data also were compiled from Science Talent Search records and combined with data from the U. S. Office of Education and the Census Bureau to conduct an analysis of factors contributing to success in the contest.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Most Science Talent Search winners over the period in question were White males from large urban schools with greater financial resources. Women and African American students were underrepresented, as were students from rural areas and schools with relatively few resources. Ultimately, this national competition reflected social and cultural forces that shaped the science professions in a crucial period of their growth, and may have represented a lost opportunity to make scientific training more truly meritocratic at a formative time in its development.

AB A critical task in psychotherapy research is identifying the conditions within which treatment benefits can be replicated and outside of which those benefits are reduced. We tested the robustness of beneficial effects found in two previous trials of the modular Child STEPs treatment program for youth anxiety, depression, trauma, and conduct problems. We conducted a randomized trial, with two significant methodological changes from previous trials: (a) shifting from cluster- to person-level randomization, and (b) shifting from individual to more clinically feasible group-based consultation with STEPs therapists. Fifty community clinicians from multiple outpatient clinics were randomly assigned to receive training and consultation in STEPs (n = 25) or to provide usual care (UC; n = 25). There were 156 referred youths-ages 6-16 (M = 10.52, SD = 2.53); 48.1% male; 79.5% Caucasian, 12.8% multiracial, 4.5% Black, 1.9% Latino, 1.3% Other-who were randomized to STEPs (n = 77) or UC (n = 79). Following previous STEPs trials, outcome measures included parent- and youth-reported internalizing, externalizing, total, and idiographic top problems, with repeated measures collected weekly during treatment and longer term over 2 years. Participants in both groups showed statistically significant improvement on all measures, leading to clinically meaningful problem reductions. However, in contrast to previous trials, STEPs was not superior to UC on any measure. As with virtually all treatments, the benefits of STEPs may depend on the conditions-for example, of study design and implementation support-in which it is tested. Identifying those conditions may help guide appropriate use of STEPs, and other treatments, in the future.

AB Background. Vocal fatigue is a common but poorly defined complaint of patients presenting with voice disorders. Definitions of vocal fatigue generally include increased self-perceived phonatory effort resulting from references to vocal loading or prolonged voice use resulting in deterioration of function. The present study looks at the role of posture, specifically head position and stance, in self-perceived phonatory effort.
   Methods. Forty-six healthy adults, 13 males and 33 females (mean age was 27.5), with no history of vocal problems/ disorders within the past year were recruited. Subjects were asked to sustain the vowel /a/ at a comfortable pitch and loudness for 5-10 seconds in each of six positions: sitting and standing in the manner habitual for each subject, two exaggerated positions of the head (head back and head forward), and two exaggerated positions in standing (standing with knees locked and with knees soft). Each position was repeated three times in randomized order, resulting in 18 trials for each subject. After each repetition of the sustained /a/, subjects were asked to rate their experience of vocal effort using a 100-mm visual analog scale (0-40 least effort, 40-60 habitual effort, and 60-100 increased effort).
   Results. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant difference in the self-perceived phonatory effort levels across positions (P value < 0.001). The exaggerated forward and back head positions in both sitting and standing positions showed the greatest significance on the Tukey post hoc tests (P < 0.000).
   Conclusions. Based on the findings, posture may play a more important role in vocal fatigue than previously thought.

AB IMPORTANCE An increasing prevalence of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and treatment has been reported in clinical settings and administrative data in the United States. However, there are limited data on recent trends of adult ADHD diagnosis among racial/ethnic subgroups.
   OBJECTIVE To examine trends, including associated demographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnoses, and negative outcomes, in the prevalence and incidence of adult ADHD diagnosis among 7 racial/ethnic groups during a 10-year period.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study investigated trends in the diagnosis of ADHD in adults who identified as African American or black, Native American, Pacific Islander, Latino or Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, Asian American, or other using the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health plan medical records. A total of 5 282 877 adult patients and 867 453 children aged 5 to 11 years who received care at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from January 1, 20 07, to December 31, 2016, were included. Data analysis was performed from January 2017 through September 2019.
   EXPOSURES Period of ADHD diagnosis.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence and incidence of licensed mental health clinic an diagnosed ADHD in adults and prevalence of licensed mental health clinician-diagnosed ADHD in children aged 5 to 11 years.
   RESULTS Of 5 282 877 adult patients (1155 790 [21.9%] aged 25-34 years; 2 667 562 [50.5%] women; 2 204 493 [41.7%] white individuals), 59 371(1.12%) received diagnoses of ADHD. Prevalence increased from 0.43% in 20 07 to 0.96% in 2016. Among 867 453 children aged 5 to 11 years (424 449 [48.9%] girls; 260 236 [30.0%] white individuals), prevalence increased from 2.96% in 20 07 to 3.74% in 2016. During the study period, annual adult ADHD prevalence increased for every race/ethnicity, but white individuals consistently had the highest prevalence rates (white individuals: 0.67%-1.42%; black individuals: 0.22%-0.69%; Native American individuals: 0.56%114%; Pacific Islander individuals: 0.11%-0.39%; Hispanic or Latino individuals: 0.25%-0.65%; Asian American individuals: 0.11%-0.35%; individuals from other races/ethnicities: 0.29%-0.71%). Incidence of ADHD diagnosis per 10 0 0 0 person-years increased from 9.43 in 20 07 to 13.49 in 2016. Younger age (eg, >65 years vs 18-24 years: odds ratio [OR], 0.094; 95% CI, 0.088-0.101; P < .001), male sex (women: OR, 0.943; 95% CI, 0.928-0.959; P < .001), white race (eg, Asian patients vs white patients: OR, 0.248; 95% CI, 0.240-0.257; P < .001), being divorced (OR, 1131; 95% CI, 1.093-1.171; P < .001), being employed (eg, retired vs employed persons: OR, 0.278; 95% CI, 0.267-0.290; P < .001), and having a higher median education level (OR, 2.156; 95% CI, 2.062-2.256; P < .001) were positively associated with odds of ADHD diagnosis. Having an eating disorder (OR, 5.192; 95% CI, 4.926-5.473; P < .001), depressive disorder (OR, 4.118; 95% CI, 4.030-4.207; P < .001), bipolar disorder (OR, 4.722; 95% CI, 4.556-4.894; P < .001), or anxiety disorder (OR, 2.438; 95% CI, 2.385-2.491; P < .001) was associated with higher odds of receiving an ADHD diagnosis. Adults with ADHD had significantly higher odds of frequent health care utilization (OR, 1.303; 95% CI, 1.272-1.334; P < .001) and sexually transmitted infections (OR, 1.289; 95% CI 1.251-1.329; P < .001) compared with adults with no ADHD diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study confirmed the reported increases in rates of ADHD diagnosis among adults, showing substantially lower rates of detection among minority racial/ethnic subgroups in the United States. Higher odds of negative outcomes reflect the economic and personal consequences that substantiate the need to improve assessment and treatment of ADHD in adults.

TI The first 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic: Mortality, intubation and
   ICU rates among 104,590 patients hospitalized at 21 United States health
   systems
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Main objective
   There is limited information on how patient outcomes have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study characterizes changes in mortality, intubation, and ICU admission rates during the first 20 months of the pandemic.
   Study design and methods
   University of Wisconsin researchers collected and harmonized electronic health record data from 1.1 million COVID-19 patients across 21 United States health systems from February 2020 through September 2021. The analysis comprised data from 104,590 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Inclusion criteria for the analysis were: (1) age 18 years or older; (2) COVID-19 ICD-10 diagnosis during hospitalization and/or a positive COVID-19 PCR test in a 14-day window (+/- 7 days of hospital admission); and (3) health system contact prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. Outcomes assessed were: (1) mortality (primary), (2) endotracheal intubation, and (3) ICU admission.
   Results and significance
   The 104,590 hospitalized participants had a mean age of 61.7 years and were 50.4% female, 24% Black, and 56.8% White. Overall risk-standardized mortality (adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, insurance status and medical comorbidities) declined from 16% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (95% CI: 16% to 17%) early in the pandemic (February-April 2020) to 9% (CI: 9% to 10%) later (July-September 2021). Among subpopulations, males (vs. females), those on Medicare (vs. those on commercial insurance), the severely obese (vs. normal weight), and those aged 60 and older (vs. younger individuals) had especially high mortality rates both early and late in the pandemic. ICU admission and intubation rates also declined across these 20 months.
   Conclusions
   Mortality, intubation, and ICU admission rates improved markedly over the first 20 months of the pandemic among adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients although gains varied by subpopulation. These data provide important information on the course of COVID-19 and identify hospitalized patient groups at heightened risk for negative outcomes.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between school connectedness and performance in standardized test scores and whether this association was moderated by ethnic private regard. Method: The study combines self-report data with school district reported data on standardized test scores in reading and math and free and reduced lunch status. Participants included 436 Mexican-origin youth attending a middle school in a southwestern U.S. state. Participants were on average 12.34 years of age (SD = .95) and 51.8% female and 48.2% male. Results: After controlling for age, gender, free and reduced lunch status, and generational status, school connectedness and ethnic private regard were both positive predictors of standardized test scores in reading and math. Results also revealed a significant interaction between school connectedness and ethnic private regard in predicting standardized test scores in reading, such that participants who were low on ethnic private regard and low on school connectedness reported lower levels of achievement compared to participants who were low on ethnic private regard but high on school connectedness. At high levels of ethnic private regard, high or low levels of school connectedness were not associated with higher or lower standardized test scores in reading. Conclusion: The findings in this study provide support for the protective role that ethnic private regard plays in the educational experiences of Mexican-origin youth and highlights how the local school context may play a role in shaping this finding.

AB Charter schools have substantial bipartisan support for their expansion. Yet, the bulk of charter school research ascertains that the majority of students in charter schools do not significantly outscore their traditional school peers on measurable indicators of academic performance. Additionally, students in charter schools do not have comparable schooling experiences to their middle-class, White peers in affluent urban and suburban schools. Using critical race theory to analyze recent charter school research, we challenge the notion of marketplace theory as a viable reform strategy to create more equitable education, and we suggest that the substantial financial profits associated with charter schools are one reason policymakers continue to ignore the negative outcomes of charter schools and push for the creation of more charter schools.

TI Honor Your Contract: Finding Sensibility in Community Colleges
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
DE community college; racial contract; autoethnography; student sensibility
ID TIME
AB Background/Context: Community colleges are seen as malleable institutions that work closely with high schools, vocational programs, employers, and community organizations to provide an education for all members of their local community. As an extension of the community, the education provided must address larger social changes (i.e., Affirmative Action, Title IX regulations) while simultaneously adjusting to the needs of the student population (i.e., food pantries, financial insecurities, homelessness, job outlook). This is a major responsibility, and working with these organizations to create programs designed to serve the needs of the people requires an agreement, or a social contract formed between these organizations and the community college. Due to the various needs of students and other social factors that create unique circumstances for certain groups, including racial minorities, neurodiverse populations, and the like, it is important to look at this contract with a critical eye. Using Charles W. Mills's (1997) framework on the racial contract and collaborative autoethnography, we examined our lived experiences as members of a community college on the East Coast to understand how the racial contract shaped our social interactions and self-perceptions as a faculty member and as a student of color in higher education. This is accomplished by applying Robin Isserles's (2021) concept of student sensibility, which asserts that academia is geared toward certain populations being successful, and because of this, students of color often struggle to develop a sense of belonging and achieve student success outcomes. Further, we provide implications for creating a more equitable workplace and learning place for faculty and students of color, respectively, at community colleges.Purpose: The purpose of the article is to explore student sensibility at an East Coast community college using the racial contract framework. It is explored through the experiences of Wonmai, a Thai American, cisgender, female PhD student (formerly a community college student) and Myron, a Black, cisgender, male sociology professor at the same community college. In the first half of the collaborative autoethnography, the student describes how her identity informed her transition from high school to college and shaped her sense of belonging and navigation within higher education. In the other half of the collaborative autoethnography, the professor illustrates how his dedication to supporting students from minority backgrounds has led to an overreliance on him as a faculty resource. The professor not only discusses his experiences as a faculty resource, but also discusses the role that racial outsourcing plays, or the ways in which academic institutions rely on faculty of color to provide an equitable educational experience and other services to students of color (as cited in Wingfield, 2019). Collectively, they share how race, racism, and the institutional culture within higher education shape the ways in which they see themselves as faculty and student. Overall, the goal of this article is to add to the scholarship on student development and faculty involvement, as well as critique institutional racial practices that continue to limit the outcomes of students and faculty of color altogether.Research Design: We utilize a collaborative autoethnography approach to explore student sensibility, racial outsourcing, and the racial contract.
   We chose this approach rather than the traditional autoethnographic approach to circumvent some of the ethical challenges of the traditional autoethnographic approach like issues with enactment of relational ethics, researcher vulnerability, degree of rigor, and the risk of leaning toward self-indulgence (Lapadat, 2017). By working together and sharing our personal stories to explore the impact of the racial contract and racial outsourcing on student sensibility, this methodology shifts the focus from a singular analysis to a collective perspective.Findings: Autoethnographic analysis yielded complex results. The PhD student experienced overt racist incidents and microaggression in high school and struggled to find a sense of belonging. Although she felt isolated and invalidated in high school, this experience was a vast contrast to her newer experience at the community college. At the community college, she was able to thrive and find a sense of belonging through the programs and opportunities. Although there are programs and policies that help students make sense and gain comfortability, the professor focused on the physical and emotional labor that faculty of color bear in the community college environment, which places obstacles such as racial outsourcing and heavy workload on faculty of color, resulting in heavy emotional work, among other outcomes.Conclusions: This article explores how the role of the racial contract and racial outsourcing shape student sensibility by using collaborative autoethnography about a former community college student of color and a current community college professor of color on the East Coast. Though there are limitations to this article, much can be learned from the analysis, which shows that the results were complex. The social contract between community colleges and the larger community has had a positive impact on student sensibility. The student was able to thrive and find sensibility within the community college system, compared to her secondary education experience. As result, she was able to take advantage of educational opportunities and explore many different interests, such as theater and studying abroad. However, applying a racial contract framework to the student sensibility, the professor illuminates that faculty issues, such as racial outsourcing, heavy workload, and the like, result in increased physical and emotional labor that affect not only student sensibility, but also the sense of belonging of faculty of color in higher education. Afrofuturism is discussed as a way to transcend the hegemonic structure. Through creative assignments and placing experience at the center, it can be a liberatory and experiential way of learning for many students because they are able to connect personal experiences to academic discussions through things they find meaningful.

AB More comprehensive modeling of psychopathology in youth is needed to facilitate a developmentally informed expansion of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model. In this study, we examined a symptom-level model of the structure of psychopathology in children and adolescents-most aged 11 to 17 years-bringing together data from large clinical, community, and representative samples (N = 18,290) covering nearly all major forms of mental disorders and related content domains (e.g., aggression). The resulting hierarchical and dimensional model was based on the points of convergence among three statistical approaches and included 15 narrow dimensions nested under four broad dimensions of (a) internalizing, (b) externalizing, (c) eating pathology, and (d) uncontrollable worry, obsessions, and compulsions. We position these findings within the context of the existing literature and articulate implications for future research. Ultimately, these findings add to the rapidly growing literature on the structure of psychopathology in youth and move a step closer toward quantifying (dis)continuities in psychopathology's structure across the life span.
